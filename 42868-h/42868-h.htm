<h2>A DEDICATION</h2>


<div class='poem2'>
<i>To every other little bride<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">Who has a "Bob" to please,</span><br />
And says she's tried and tried and tried<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">To cook with skill and ease,</span><br />
And can't!&mdash;we offer here as guide<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">Bettina's Recipes!</span></i><br />
<br />
<i>To her whose "Bob" is prone to wear<br />
A sad and hungry look,<br />
Because the maid he thought so fair<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">Is&mdash;well&mdash;she just can't cook!</span><br />
To her we say: do not despair;<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">Just try Bettina's Book!</span></i><br />

<h2>CHAPTER I</h2>

<div class='chaptertitle'>HOME AT LAST</div>


<div class="image-left">
<img src="images/oi_013.jpg" width="273" height="270" alt="couple sitting down to eat" />
</div>

<div class='unindent'><span class='letter'>"H</span>OME at last!" sighed
Bettina happily as the
hot and dusty travelers left the
train.</div>

<p>"Why that contented sigh?"
asked Bob. "Because our wedding
trip is over? Well, anyhow,
Bettina, it's after five.
Shall we have dinner at the
hotel?"</p>

<p>"Hotel? Why, Bob! with our
house and our dishes and our silver just waiting for us? I'm
ashamed of you! We'll take the first car for home&mdash;a street-car,
not a taxi! Our extravagant days are over, and the time
has come to show you that Bettina knows how to keep house.
You think that you love me now, Bobby, but just wait till you
sit down to a real strawberry shortcake made by a real cook
in a real home!"</p>

<p>Half an hour later Bob was unlocking the door of the new
brown bungalow. "Isn't it a dear?" cried Bettina proudly.
"When we've had time to give it grass and shrubs and flowers
and a vegetable garden, no place in town will equal it! And
as for porch furniture, how I'd like to get at Mother's attic and
transform some of her discarded things!"</p>

<p>"Just now I'd rather get at some of Mother's cooking!"
grinned Bob.</p><p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_12" id="Page_12">[12]</a></span></p>

<p>"Oh, dear, I forgot! I'll have supper ready in ten minutes.
Do you remember my emergency shelf? Why, Bob&mdash;Bob,
they must have known we were coming! Here's ice&mdash;and
milk&mdash;and cream&mdash;and butter&mdash;and bread&mdash;and rolls, and even
a grape fruit! They knew, and didn't meet the train because
they thought we would prefer to have our first meal alone!
Wasn't that dear of them? And this will save you a trip to
the corner grocery!"</p>

<p>Bettina fastened a trim percale bungalow apron over her
traveling suit, and swiftly and surely assembled the little meal.</p>

<p>"I like that apron," said Bob. "It reminds me of the rainy
day when we fixed the emergency shelf. That was fun."</p>

<p>"Yes, and work too," said Bettina, "but I'm glad we did it.
Do you remember how much I saved by getting things in dozen
and half dozen lots? And Mother showed me how much
better it was to buy the larger sizes in bottled things, because
in buying the smaller bottles you spend most of your money
for the glass. Now that you have to pay my bills, Bob, you'll
be glad that I know those things!"</p>

<p>"I think you know a great deal," said Bob admiringly. "Lots
of girls can cook, but mighty few know how to be economical
at the same time! It's great to be your&mdash;&mdash;"</p>

<p>"Dinner is served," Bettina interrupted. "It's a 'pick-up
meal,' but I'm hungry, aren't you? And after this, sir, no
more canned things!"</p>

<p>And Bob sat down to:</p>

<div class='recipetitle'><b>Creamed Tuna on Toast Strips</b> (Two portions)</div>

<div class='ingredients1'>
1 <abbr title="tablespoon">T</abbr>-butter<br />

¼ <abbr title="teaspoon">t</abbr>-salt<br />

3 slices of bread<br />
½ <abbr title="cup">C</abbr>-tuna</div>
<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_13" id="Page_13">[13]</a></span></p>


<p>Melt the butter, add the flour, salt and pimento. Mix well.
Gradually pour in the milk. Allow the mixture to boil one
minute. Stir constantly. Add the fish, cook one minute and
pour over toasted strips of bread.</p>


<div class='recipetitle'><b>Hot Chocolate</b> (Three cups)</div>

<div class='ingredients1'>
1 square of chocolate<br />
3 <abbr title="tablespoon">T</abbr>-sugar<br />

2 <abbr title="cup">C</abbr>-milk<br />
¼ <abbr title="teaspoon">t</abbr>-vanilla<br />
3 marshmallows<br />
</div>


<p>Cook chocolate, sugar and water until a thin custard is
formed. Add milk gradually and bring to a boil. Whip with
an egg beater, as this breaks up the albumin found in chocolate,
and prevents the coating from forming over the top. Add
vanilla and marshmallows. Allow to stand a moment and pour
into the cups.</p>


<div class='recipetitle'><b>Strawberry Preserves</b> (Six one-half pt. glasses)</div>


<div class='ingredients1'>4 lbs. berries<br />
3 lbs. sugar<br />
3 <abbr title="cup">C</abbr>-water<br /></div>



<p>Pick over, wash and hull the berries. Make a syrup by
boiling the sugar and water fifteen minutes. Fill sterilized jars
with the berries. Cover with syrup and let stand fifteen
minutes to settle. Add more berries. Adjust rubbers and
covers. Place on a folded cloth in a kettle of cold water. Heat
water to boiling point and cook slowly one hour. Screw on
covers securely.</p>

<h2>CHAPTER II</h2>

<div class='chaptertitle'>BETTINA'S FIRST REAL DINNER</div>


<div class='cap'>"SAY, isn't it great to be alive!" exclaimed Bob, as he
looked across the rose-decked table at the flushed but
happy Bettina. "And a beefsteak dinner, too!"</div>

<p>"Steak is expensive, dear, and you'll not get it often, but as
this is our first real dinner in our own home, I had to celebrate.
I bought enough for two meals, because buying steak
for one meal for two people is beyond any modest purse! So
you'll meet that steak again tomorrow, but I don't believe that
you'll bow in recognition!"</p>

<p>"So you marketed today, did you?"</p>

<p>"Indeed I did! I bought a big basket, and went at it like
a seasoned housekeeper. I had all the staples to get, you
know, and lots of other things. After dinner I'll show you
the labelled glass jars on my shelves; it was such fun putting
things away! June is a wonderful month for housekeepers.
I've planned the meals for days ahead, because I know that's
best. Then I'll go to the market several times a week, and
if I plan properly I won't have to order by telephone. It
seems so extravagant to buy in that way unless you know
exactly what you are getting. I like to plan for left-overs,
too. For instance, the peas in this salad were left from
yesterday's dinner, and the pimento is from that can I opened.
Then, too, I cooked tomorrow's potatoes with these to save
gas and bother. You'll have them served in a different way,
of course. And&mdash;&mdash; Oh, yes, Bob," Bettina chattered on, "I
saw Ruth down town, and have asked all five of my bridesmaids<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_15" id="Page_15">[15]</a></span>
to luncheon day after tomorrow. Won't that be fun?
But I promise you that the neglected groom shall have every
one of the good things when he comes home at night!"</p>

<p>"It makes me feel happy, I can tell you, to have a home like
this. It's pleasant to be by ourselves, but at the same time
I can't help wishing that some of the bachelors I know could
see it all and taste your cooking!"</p>

<p>"Well, Bob, I want you to feel free to have a guest at any
time. If my dinners are good enough for you, I'm sure they're
good enough for any guest whom you may bring. And it
isn't very hard to make a meal for three out of a meal for two.
Now, Bobby, if you're ready, will you please get the dessert?"</p>

<p>"What? Strawberry shortcake? Well, this is living! I tell
you what, Bettina, I call this a regular man-size meal!"</p>

<p>It consisted of:</p>

1 <abbr title="teaspoon">t</abbr>-parsley chopped<br />
</div>

<p>Wipe the meat carefully with a wet cloth. Remove superfluous
fat and any gristle. Cut the edges to prevent them
from curling up. When the broiling oven is very hot, place
the meat, without any fat, upon a hot flat pan, directly under
the blaze. Brown both sides very quickly. Turn often. Reduce
heat and continue cooking about seven minutes, or longer
if desired. Place on a warm platter; season with salt, pepper
and bits of butter. Set in the oven a moment to melt the
butter. If salt is added while cooking, the juices will be drawn
out. A gravy may be made by adding hot water, butter, salt,
pepper and parsley to the pan. Pour the gravy over the
steak.</p><p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_16" id="Page_16">[16]</a></span></p>

<p>Scrape four medium sized new potatoes. Cook in boiling
water (salted) until tender when pierced with a fork. Drain
off the water, and shake the kettle over the fire gently, to allow
the steam to escape and make the potatoes mealy. Make the
following white sauce and pour over the potatoes.</p>

<h2>CHAPTER III</h2>

<div class='chaptertitle'>BETTINA'S FIRST GUEST</div>


<div class='cap'>"HELLO! Yes, this is Bettina! Why, Bob, of course!
Is he a real woman-hater? No, I've never met any,
but I'll just invite Alice, too, and tomorrow you won't be
calling him that. Six-thirty? Yes, I'll be ready for you both;
I'm so glad you asked him. He'll be our first guest! Good-bye!"</div>

<p>Bettina left the telephone with more misgivings than her
tone had indicated. She couldn't disappoint Bob, and she
liked unexpected company, but the dinner which she had
planned was prepared largely from the recipes filed as "left-overs"
in her box of indexed cards.</p>

<p>"Well, Bob will like it, anyhow," she declared confidently,
"and if Alice can come, we'll have enough scintillating table-talk
to make up for disappointments."</p>

<p>Alice accepted with delight, promising to wear "a dream of
a gown that just came home," and confessing to a sentimental
feeling at the thought of dining with such a new bride and
groom.</p>

<p>"Let's see," said Bettina in her spick and span little kitchen,
"there is meat enough, but I must hard-boil some eggs to help
out these potatoes. 'Potatoes Anna' will be delicious. Goodness,
what would my home economics teacher have said if she
had heard me say 'hard-boil'? They mustn't really be boiled
at all, just 'hard-cooked' in water kept at the boiling point.
There will be enough baked green peppers for four, and
enough of the pudding, and if I add some very good coffee<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_18" id="Page_18">[18]</a></span>,
I don't believe that Bob's Mr. Harrison will feel that women
are such nuisances after all! It isn't an elaborate meal, but
it's wholesome, and at any rate, our gas bill will be a little
smaller because everything goes into the oven."</p>

<p>When Alice arrived, Bettina was putting the finishing
touches on her table. "Alice, you look stunning!"</p>

<p>"And you look lovely, which is better! And the table is
charming! Those red clover blossoms in that brown basket
make a perfect center-piece! How did you think of it?"</p>

<p>"Mother Necessity reminded me, my dear! My next door
neighbor has roses, but I covet some for my luncheon tomorrow,
and did not like to ask for any today. So I had to use
these red clover blooms from our own back yard. They are
simple, like the dinner."</p>

<p>"Don't you envy me, Harrison?" asked Bob at the table.
"This is my third day of real home cooking! You were unexpected
company, too!"</p>

<p>The dinner consisted of:</p>

<h2>CHAPTER IV</h2>

<div class='chaptertitle'>BETTINA GIVES A LUNCHEON</div>


<div class='cap'>"O YOU darling Bettina! Did you do it all yourself?"
Mary exclaimed impulsively, as the girls admired the
dainty first course which their hostess set before them.
"Everything is pink and white, like the wedding!"</div>

<p>"Yes," said Bettina, "and those maline bows on the basket
of roses actually attended my wedding. And after this is over,
you may see that maline again. I expect to press it out and
put it away for other pink luncheons in other Junes! Today,
since my guests were to be just my bridesmaids, I thought that
a pink luncheon would be the most appropriate kind."</p>

<p>"Isn't it fine to be in Bettina's own house? I can't realize
it!" said Ellen. "And the idea of daring to cook a whole
luncheon and serve it in courses all by herself! Why, Bettina,
how did you know what to have?"</p>

<p>"Well," said Bettina, "I went to the market and saw all the
inexpensive things that one can buy in June! (They had to
be inexpensive! Why, if I were to tell you just what this
luncheon cost, you'd laugh. But I want you to like it all before
I give that secret away.) And then in planning my menu, I
thought of pinky things that went together. That was all, you
see."</p>

<p>"But didn't it take hours and hours to prepare everything?"</p>

<p>"Why, no. I thought it all out first, and wrote it down, and
did most of it yesterday. I've found that five minutes of
planning is worth five hours of unplanned work. I haven't
hurried, and as Bob will have this same meal as his dinner
tonight, I didn't have to think of him except to plan for more.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_22" id="Page_22">[22]</a></span>
You see, I estimated each portion as carefully as I could, for it
isn't necessary to have a lot of left-over things. Tonight I'll
wear this same pink gown at dinner so that Bob will get every
bit that he can of my first luncheon except the silly girls who
flattered the cook."</p>

<p>"Bettina, there are so many things I'd like to ask you!" said
Ruth, who was a little conscious of the shining ring on her left
hand. "Tell me, for instance, how you shaped these cunning
timbales. With your hands?"</p>

<p>"With a conical ice-cream mould. It is so easy that way."</p>

<p>"And this salad! Fred is so fond of salad, but I don't know
a thing about making it."</p>

<p>"Well, I washed the lettuce thoroughly, and when it was
very wet I put it on the ice in a cloth. I poured boiling water
over these tomatoes to make the skins peel off easily. And,
oh, yes, these cucumbers are crisp because I kept the slices in
ice water for awhile before I served them. Good salad is
always very cold; the ingredients ought to be chilled before
they are mixed."</p>

<p>"These dear little cakes, Bettina! How could you make
them in such cunning shapes?"</p>

<p>"With a fancy cutter. And I dipped it in warm water each
time before I used it, so that it would cut evenly. I'd love to
show you girls all that I know about cooking. Do learn it now
while you're at home; it will save much labor and even tears!
Why, Bob said&mdash;&mdash;"</p>

<p>"I knew that was coming!" laughed Alice. "Girls, in self-defense,
let's keep the conversation strictly on Betty's menu,
and away from Betty's husband!"</p>

<p>And so they discussed:</p>

to shape into a small mould. Remove from glasses onto centers
of paper doilies placed on fruit plates. Attractively

<p>Melt the butter, stir flour in well, and slowly add the milk.
Let it boil about two minutes, stirring constantly. Season, add

<h2>CHAPTER V</h2>

<div class='chaptertitle'>BOB HELPS TO GET DINNER</div>


<div class='cap'>"GUESS who!" said a voice behind Bettina, as two hands
blinded her eyes.</div>

<p>"Why, Bob, dear! Good for you! How did you get home
so early?"</p>

<p>"I caught a ride with Dixon in his new car. And I thought
you might need me to help get dinner; it's nice to be needed!
But here I've been picturing you toiling over a hot stove, and,
instead, I find you on the porch with a magazine, as cool as a
cucumber!"</p>

<p>"The day of toiling over a hot stove in summer is over. At
least for anyone with sense! But I'm glad you did come home
early, and you <em>can</em> help with dinner. Will you make the
French dressing for the salad? See, I'll measure it out, and
you can stir it this way with a fork until it's well mixed and a
little thick."</p>

<p>"I know a much better way than that. Just watch your
Uncle Bob; see? I'll put it in this little Mason jar and shake
it. It's a lot easier and&mdash;there you are! We'll use what we
need tonight, put the jar away in the ice-box, and the next
time we can give it another good shaking before we use it."</p>

<p>"Why, Bob, what an ingenious boy you are! I never would
have thought of that!"</p>

<p>"You married a man with brains, Betty dear! What is
there besides the salad?"</p>

<p>"Halibut steak. It's Friday, you know, and there is such
good inexpensive fish on the market. A pound is plenty for<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_26" id="Page_26">[26]</a></span>
us. The potatoes are ready for the white sauce, the beans
are in the fireless cooker, and for dessert there is fresh pineapple
sliced. The pineapple is all ready. Will you get it,
dear? In the ice-box in a covered jar."</p>

<p>"Why didn't you slice it into the serving dish?"</p>

<p>"Because it had to be covered tight. Pineapple has a penetrating
odor, and milk and butter absorb it in no time."</p>

<p>"What else shall I do, Madam Bettina?"</p>

<p>"Well, you may fix the lemon for the fish. No, not sliced;
a slice is too hard to handle. Just cut it in halves and then
once the other way, in quarters; see? You may also cut up
a little of that parsley for the creamed new potatoes. That
reminds me that I am going to have parsley growing in a
kitchen window box some day. Now you can take the beans
out of the cooker, and I'll put butter sauce on them. No, it
isn't really a sauce,&mdash;just melted butter with salt and pepper.
There, Bobby dear! Dinner is served, and you helped! How
do you like the coreopsis on the table?"</p>

<p>"You always manage to have flowers of some kind, don't
you, Betty? I'm growing so accustomed to that little habit of
yours that I suppose I wouldn't have any appetite if I had to
eat on an ordinary undecorated table!"</p>

<p>"Don't you make fun of me, old fellow! You'd have an
appetite no matter when, how or what you had to eat! But
things are good tonight, aren't they?"</p>

<h2>CHAPTER VI</h2>

<div class='chaptertitle'>COUSIN MATILDA CALLS</div>


<div class='cap'>"HELLO, is this you, Bettina? This is Mother! I'll
have to speak in a low voice. Who do you think is
here? No,&mdash;Cousin Matilda! Just between trains, but she
says she must see how you are 'situated'! Clementine has
such a wonderful establishment now, you know! No, of
course not, but I want her to see how happy you are. She
seems to have the idea that an 'establishment' is necessary!
Just to see the house, you know! I know the porch isn't
ready, but don't worry! About three, then. Good-by!"</div>

<p>That afternoon Bettina looked anxiously through the living
room window across the bare little front yard. If only critical
Cousin Matilda had waited a few months before coming! But
then, the only thing to do was to be as cheerful about it as
possible&mdash;&mdash;</p>

<p>"So this is little Bettina!" said a majestic voice at the door.
"And how is love in a cottage? How charmingly simple
everything is!"</p>

<p>"They planned it all just as they wanted it," explained
Bettina's mother proudly. "On a small scale, of course, but
perhaps some day&mdash;&mdash;"</p>

<p>"But I couldn't ever be happier than I am right now, Cousin
Matilda. What do you think of our big living room? Browns
and tans seemed best and safest in a little house like this, and
I knew I shouldn't tire of them as of any other color! I do
so dislike going into a bungalow with one little room in blue,
another in pink, and so on. The walls are all alike, even in<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_29" id="Page_29">[29]</a></span>
the bedrooms. And the curtains are just simple cotton voiles,
ecru in the living and dining rooms, and white in the bedrooms.
No side curtains to catch the dust and keep out the
air. But I beg your pardon for seeming too complacent; I
love it all so that I just can't help boasting."</p>

<p>"What is this, my dear? A wedding gift?"</p>

<p>"Yes, isn't it lovely? It is a sampler in cross-stitch that
Bob's great-great-grandmother made! His Aunt Margaret had
it put under the glass cover of this tea cart, and gave it to us
for a wedding present. See, the cart is brown willow, and I
think it looks well with our furniture, don't you? This is to
be a living porch, but we haven't furnished it yet except for
this green matting rug. And Bob brought that hanging basket
home from the florist's the other day.... Oh, yes, this is my
Japanese garden! Bob laughs at me, I have so much fun
watching it."</p>

<p>"What a lovely table decoration those red cherries make in
your dining room, my dear! Like a picture, in that piece of
dull green pottery!"</p>

<p>"Yes, Bob says I decorate the table differently for every
meal! We use this breakfast alcove for breakfast, Sunday
evening tea, or any informal meal when we are alone. You
see how convenient it is! I do want to put a round serving
table with leaves on our living porch. Then we can eat there
on warm evenings in summer."</p>

<p>"Bettina is very accomplished in economy," said her mother.
"You must let her tell you some of her methods."</p>

<p>"Clementine would be interested, I'm sure," said Cousin
Matilda in her languid way. "Is this your guest room?"</p>

<p>"Yes, and Bob and I are proud of that. We white enameled
the furniture ourselves! It is some that we found in a second-hand
store, and it was certainly a bargain, though it didn't
look it at the time. I sewed the rags together for these blue
and white rugs. Bob made that little open desk out of a small
table that we found somewhere. Now that it is white, too, I
think it is cunning. And, Cousin Matilda, I give you three
guesses as to the place in which I keep my sewing machine!"</p>

<p>"Why, I haven't seen it yet. In the kitchen?"</p><p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_30" id="Page_30">[30]</a></span></p>

<p>"Goodness, no! Well, I'll tell you! This looks like a dressing
table, but is merely a shelf with a mirror above it. The
shelf has a cretonne cover and 'petticoat' that reaches the floor.
And underneath it&mdash;behold the sewing machine! Bob made
the shelf high enough and wide enough to let the sewing
machine slip under it! But, Cousin Matilda, you must be tired
of Bettina's economies! Please sit down with mother in the
living room and I will get the 'party.'"</p>

<p>And Bettina wheeled her tea cart into the kitchen, returning
with luncheon napkins, plates, glasses, a pitcher of iced fruit
juice, a plate of little chocolate cakes, and several sprays of
wild roses.</p>

<p>"What delicious little cakes, Bettina! At least you can't be
called economical when you serve such rich and dainty food as
this!"</p>

<p>"I must plead guilty still, Cousin Matilda. I made these
little cakes partly from dry bread crumbs. The fruit juice is
mostly from the pineapple which Bob had for dessert last night.
I cooked the core with about two cups of water and added it
to the lemonade."</p>

<p>"Bettina, Bettina! How did you learn these things? Robert
is certainly a lucky man, and I'm sure that some day he
will be a wealthy one! You must give me the recipes you
used!"</p>

<p>And Bettina wrote them down as follows:</p>

</div>

<div class='unindent'><span class='letter'>"Y</span>OU will go to church with
us this morning, Bettina?"
asked Bob's cousin Henry,
known also as the Rev. Henry
Clinkersmith, as he came into
Bettina's immaculate kitchen one
Sunday.</div>

<p>"Yes, indeed, I will go!" Bettina
answered him. "Is it nearly
ten o'clock? Oh, yes, nine forty-five.
I'll go at once and get
ready."</p>

<p>Cousin Henry had arrived late Saturday evening. He was
filling the pulpit of a friend that Sunday morning.</p>

<p>Bettina finished arranging the low bowl of pansies which
was to be her table decoration. "For the dinner table," she
explained to Cousin Henry.</p>

<p>"And Bob," she said as they walked to church (Cousin
Henry was ahead with an old friend), "I do believe he was
worried about dinner. There wasn't a trace of any preparation
to be seen! You know I made the cake and the salad
dressing yesterday, and the lettuce was on the ice. The sherbet
was on the porch (I bought it, you know), and the lamb
and potatoes were in the cooker."</p>

<p>"Well, let him worry! How long will it take to get it ready
after we get home?"</p><p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_34" id="Page_34">[34]</a></span></p>

<p>"About fifteen minutes. The table is set, but I'll have to
warm the plates and take things up. Then there's the gravy
to make, of course."</p>

<p>"All I can say is this," said Cousin Henry at dinner, as he
passed his plate for a second helping, "since you've explained
the mysteries of the fireless cooker, I realize how it would
have helped those cold Sunday dinners of the past generation.
The women could have obeyed the fourth commandment and
given their families a good Sunday dinner, too!"</p>

<p>That day they had:</p>

<h2>CHAPTER VIII</h2>

<div class='chaptertitle'>CELEBRATING THE FOURTH</div>


<div class='cap'>"NOW, boys, run and play while Alice and I set the picnic
table!" said Bettina to Bob and Mr. Harrison. "See
if the fish are biting! Cultivate your patience as well as your
appetites and we'll surprise you soon!"</div>

<p>"Bettina, let me help you unpack. Everything looks so
dainty and interesting!" said Alice, as Bob and Mr. Harrison
strolled off toward the river. "You ought to have allowed me
to bring something, although I'll admit that I do enjoy being
surprised. You were a dear to bring me with you!"</p>

<p>"I?" said Bettina. "Of course I'm glad to have you here&mdash;no
one is better fun&mdash;but I wish you had heard something that
Bob told me. He and Harry Harrison were planning to go
fishing today, all by themselves, until Harry suggested that
Bob might like to bring me along. And then he added as an
afterthought, that as three is a crowd, Miss Alice might be
induced to come too. (Why is it that 'Miss Alice' or 'Miss
Kate' or 'Miss May' always sounds so like a confirmed bachelor?)
Bob chuckled when he told me how careless and offhand
Harry tried to be!"</p>

<p>"Betty, how pretty those pasteboard plates are with the flag-seals
pasted on them!"</p>

<p>"I saw some ready-made Fourth of July plates, but it was
more economical to make my own. And how do you like the
red, white and blue paper napkins and lunch cloth? 'Lunch
paper,' I ought to say, I suppose. Alice, you arrange the fruit
in the center in this basket, with some napkins around it, and<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_37" id="Page_37">[37]</a></span>
with these little flags sticking out of it in every direction. But
first, my dear, please tell me why you changed the subject
when I was speaking of Mr. Harrison?"</p>

<p>"Those devilled eggs wrapped in frilled tissue-paper look
just like torpedoes."</p>

<p>"Alice, Alice, I learned something new about you today.
Harry said that society girls got on his nerves, but that 'Miss
Alice' seemed sensible enough!"</p>

<p>"Goodness, Betty, he has disagreed with every single thing
I've said, so far! If he is being pleasant behind my back, I
don't see why he should be so disapproving in his manner to
me! But if he is really beginning to think me sensible, let us
by all means encourage him! Hide my frivolous new hat in
the lunch-basket, and give me something useful to be doing.
Can't I appear to be mixing the salad?... Honestly, Betty,
I do get tired of society as a single interest. But what else is
there for me to do? Go into settlement work? I'd be a joke
at that! Learn to design jewelry? Take singing lessons?"</p>

<p>"Try the good old profession of matrimony. Why are you
so fickle, Alice, my dear?"</p>

<p>"I'm not; it's the men! Every sensible one I meet is&mdash;well,
disagreeable to me!"</p>

<p>"Meaning Harry Harrison? He appears to be taking quite
an interest, at least!"</p>

<p>"That is merely his reforming instinct coming to the surface.
But&mdash;is everything ready now? We'll sing a few bars of the
Star Spangled Banner, and I'm sure the men will come immediately!"</p>

<h2>CHAPTER IX</h2>

<div class='chaptertitle'>UNCLE JOHN AND AUNT LUCY MAKE A VISIT</div>


<div class='cap'>UNCLE JOHN and Aunt Lucy had driven Bob and
Bettina home from a Sunday spent in the country.</div>

<p>"Do come in," begged Bettina, "and have a little lunch with
us. After such a bountiful dinner, we really ought not to be
hungry, but I confess that the lovely drive home has given me
an appetite. And you've never been here for a meal! Don't
be frightened, Uncle John, I really thought of this yesterday,
and my cupboard isn't entirely bare. It would be so much
fun to show you our things and the house!"</p>

<p>"I'm not afraid I won't be fed well," said Uncle John, "but
those clouds are black in the east. If it should rain we'd have
trouble getting home. Besides, I don't like to have the car
standing out in a storm."</p>

<p>"I don't believe it'll rain, John," said comfortable Aunt Lucy.
"And if it does, well, we'll manage somehow. I, for one,
would like to see Bettina's kitchen&mdash;and all the rest of her
house," she added.</p>

<p>Bettina arranged the dainty little meal on the porch table,
and Aunt Lucy and Uncle John sat down with good appetites.</p>

<p>"This looks almost too pretty to eat," said he as he looked
at his plate with its slice of jellied beef on head lettuce, served
with salad dressing, and its fresh crisp potato chips. And the
nasturtium and green leaf lay beside them.</p>

<p>"Have a radish and a sandwich, Uncle John," said Bettina.
"We have plenty, if not variety. Our only dessert is fresh

<p>"But it all tastes mighty good!" said Uncle John. "Say, Bob,
it is beginning to rain, I believe!"</p><p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_40" id="Page_40">[40]</a></span></p>

<p>"Sure enough, a regular storm! We must put the car in
the empty garage across the street. I'm sure we can get permission."
And he and Uncle John hurried out.</p>

<p>"It will blow over, I'm sure," said Aunt Lucy.</p>

<p>"But if it doesn't&mdash;why, Aunt Lucy, stay here all night!
We'd love to have you! The guest room is always ready. I
know you'll be comfortable, and they can manage without you
at home for once, I'm sure."</p>

<p>"Of course they'll be all right, and it would be quite exciting
to be 'company' for a change. If only Uncle John thinks he
can do it!"</p>

<p>"It looks as if there'll be nothing else to do," said Uncle
John, when he and Bob returned. "Not but what I'd enjoy
it&mdash;but I haven't been away from home a night for&mdash;how long
is it, Lucy?"</p>

<p>"Seven years last May, John. All the more reason why
this'll do you good."</p>

<p>"Oh, I'm so glad you'll really stay!" said Bettina. "Now
tell me what you like for breakfast!"</p>

<p>"Anything you have except those new fashioned breakfast
foods," Uncle John replied. "I might feed 'em to my stock,
now, but not to a human being. But don't you worry about
me, Betty! Because I don't worry about the breakfast proposition.
Bob here is a pretty good advertisement of the kind of
cooking you can do!"</p>

<p>The lunch that night consisted of:</p>

<div class='recipetitle'><b>Jellied Beef</b> (Four portions)</div>

<div class='ingredients1'>
1 <abbr title="cup">C</abbr>-cold chopped cooked beef<br />
½ <abbr title="tablespoon">T</abbr>-chopped onion<br />
1 <abbr title="tablespoon">T</abbr>-chopped pimento<br />
½ <abbr title="teaspoon">t</abbr>-salt<br />
¼ <abbr title="teaspoon">t</abbr>-pepper<br />
1 <abbr title="tablespoon">T</abbr>-chopped parsley<br />
1 <abbr title="tablespoon">T</abbr>-lemon juice<br />
2 <abbr title="teaspoon">t</abbr>-granulated gelatin<br />

½ <abbr title="cup">C</abbr>-boiling water<br />
</div><p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_41" id="Page_41">[41]</a></span></p>

<p>Soak the gelatin in one tablespoon cold water for three minutes.
Add the boiling water and dissolve thoroughly. Add
the meat, onion, pimento, salt, pepper, lemon juice and parsley.
Stir well together and turn into a mould that has been
moistened with cold water. (A square or rectangular mould
is preferable.) Stand in a cold place for two hours. When
cold and firm, unmould on lettuce leaves and cut into slices.
Salad dressing may be served with it.</p>


<div class='recipetitle'><b>Radishes</b> (Four portions)</div>

<div class='ingredients1'>
12 radishes<br />
1 <abbr title="cup">C</abbr>-chopped ice<br />
</div>

<p>Wash the radishes thoroughly with a vegetable brush. Cut
off the long roots and all but one inch of green tops. These
tops make the radishes easier to handle and more attractive.
Serve in a bowl of chopped ice.</p>


<div class='recipetitle'><b>Peanut Butter Sandwiches</b> (Twelve sandwiches)</div>

<div class='ingredients1'>
4 <abbr title="tablespoon">T</abbr>-peanut butter<br />

<p>Cream the peanut butter, add the butter. Cream again, add
the salt and salad dressing, mixing well. Cut the bread evenly.
Butter one side of the bread very thinly with the peanut
butter mixture. Place the lettuce leaf on one slice and place
another slice upon it, buttered side down. Press firmly and
neatly together. Cut in two crosswise. Arrange attractively
in a wicker basket.</p><hr class="chap" /><p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_42" id="Page_42">[42]</a></span></p>




<h2>CHAPTER X</h2>

<div class='chaptertitle'>RUTH INSPECTS BETTINA'S KITCHEN</div>


<div class='cap'>"MAY I come in?" said a voice at the screen door. "I
came the kitchen way because I hoped that you would
still be busy with the morning's work, and I might learn something.
You see" (and Ruth blushed a little), "we are thinking
of building a house and we have lots of ideas about every room
but the kitchen. Neither Fred nor I know the first thing about
that, so I told him that I would just have to consult you."</div>

<p>"How dear of you, Ruth!" said Bettina, as she put away the
breakfast dishes. "Well, you shall have the benefit of everything
that I know. Bob and I began with the kitchen when we
planned this little house. It seemed so important. I expected
to spend a great deal of time here, and I was determined to
have it cheerful and convenient. I never could see why a
kitchen should not be a perfectly beautiful room, as beautiful
as any in the whole house!"</p>

<p>"Yours is, Bettina," said Ruth, warmly, as she looked
around her. "No wonder you can cook such fascinating little
meals. It is light, and sunny and clean looking&mdash;oh, immaculate!&mdash;and
has such a pleasant view!"</p>

<p>"I wanted it to have lots of sunshine. We had the walls
painted this shade of yellow, because it seemed pretty and
cheerful. Perhaps you won't care to have white woodwork
like this, but you see it is plain and I don't find it hard to keep
clean out here on the edge of town! I think it is so pretty
that I don't expect to regret my choice. Another thing, Ruth,
do get a good grade of inlaid linoleum like this. I know the
initial expense is greater, but a good piece will last a long time,
and will always look well."</p><p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_43" id="Page_43">[43]</a></span></p>

<p>"How high the sink is, Bettina!"</p>

<p>"Thirty-six inches. You see, I'm not very tall and yet I
have always found that every other sink I tried was too low
for solid comfort. The plumbers have a way of making them
all alike&mdash;thirty-two inches from the floor, I think. They
were scandalized because I asked them to change the regulation
height, and yet, I find this exactly right. And isn't it a
lovely white enameled one? I am happy whenever I look at it!
Don't laugh, Ruth; a sink is a very important piece of furniture!
I had always liked this kind with the grooved drain-board
on each side, sloping just a little toward the center. And
see how easily I can reach up and put away the dishes in the
cupboard, you see. I don't like a single dish or utensil in sight
when the kitchen is in order. This roll of paper toweling here
by the sink is very convenient for wiping off the table or taking
grease off pans and dishes or even for drying glass and
silver. A roll lasts a long time, and certainly does save dishcloths
and towels.</p>

<p>"Do you use your fireless cooker often?"</p>

<p>"Every day of the year&mdash;I do believe. I cook breakfast
food in it, and all kinds of meats except those that are boiled
or fried. Then it is splendid for steaming brown bread and
baking beans, and oh, so many other things! Mother keeps
hers under the kitchen table, but I find it more convenient here
at the right of the stove&mdash;on a box just level with the stove.
Next, O Neophyte, you may observe the stove. The oven is
at the side, high up so that one need not stoop to use it. It has
a glass oven door through which I can watch my baking."</p>

<p>"I like this white enameled table. And the high stool must
be convenient, too."</p>

<p>"It is splendid. Ruth, haven't you an old marble topped
table at home? It would be just the thing for pastry making."</p>

<p>"Yes, I do know of one, I think, and I'll have the lower part
enameled white."</p>

<p>"Fred can do it himself. Let him help to fix things up, and
he'll be all the more interested in them, and in helping you use
them."</p>

<p>"Bettina, this is an adorable breakfast alcove! What fun<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_44" id="Page_44">[44]</a></span>
you must have every morning! If we have one, I don't believe
we'll ever use the dining room. How convenient! Here come
the waffles&mdash;hot from the stove! Fred, do have a hot muffin!"</p>

<p>"Not at the same meal, Ruth!"</p>

<p>"No, he'll be fortunate if he gets anything to eat at all! He
isn't marrying a Bettina. But he says he's satisfied. Bettina,
does Bob help get breakfast?"</p>

<p>"Indeed he does. He loves to make coffee in the electric
percolator and toast on the toaster. He says that an electric
toaster and plenty of bath towels are the real necessities of
life, but I say I cannot live without flowers and a fireplace.
Oh, you will have such fun, Ruth! Let Fred help you all he
will."</p>

<p>"I'm hearing all this advice!" suddenly shouted a big voice
in her ear. "Look here, Mrs. Bettina, does Bob know that
you are advising your friends to train their husbands just as
you are training him?"</p>

<p>"Fred, you old eavesdropper! I hope that Ruth makes you
get breakfast every single morning to pay for this! Aren't
you ashamed? Don't you know that listeners never hear any
good of themselves?"</p>

<p>"I suppose Fred knew he needn't worry," said rosy Ruth, as
she took his arm. "Look, Fred, isn't it a dear little house?
May he see it all, Bettina?"</p>

<p>"Yes, if he'll explain how a busy man can get away at this
hour of the morning."</p>

<p>"Well, you see I was on my way to the office when I caught
a glimpse of Ruth's pink dress at your back door. I happened
to think that she said she didn't get a recipe for those
'skyrocket rolls' that you had at your party the other day. I
just thought I'd have to remind her, for the sake of my future."</p>

<p>"What under the shining sun! Oh, pinwheel biscuits!"</p>

<p>"Yes&mdash;that's it!"</p>

<p>"Why&mdash;all right. I have it filed away in my card-index.
Here&mdash;with a picture of them pasted on the card. I cut it
out of the magazine that gave the recipe. They are delicious."</p><p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_45" id="Page_45">[45]</a></span></p>

<div class='recipetitle'><b>Pinwheel Biscuits</b> (Fifteen biscuits)</div>

the cinnamon rolls made from yeast sponge.)</p><hr class="chap" /><p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_46" id="Page_46">[46]</a></span></p>




<h2>CHAPTER XI</h2>

<div class='chaptertitle'>BETTINA'S BIRTHDAY GIFT</div>


<div class='cap'>"YOUR set, Bob," said Bettina, as she gathered up the
tennis balls. "But please say you think I'm improving!
Oh, there'll come a time when I'll make you a stiff
opponent, but I'll have to work up my service first! It's time
to go home to breakfast now, but hasn't it been fun?"</div>

<p>"Fine, Betty! We'll do it again! I don't object at all to
getting up early when I'm once up! And we ought to get out
and play tennis before breakfast every day."</p>

<p>"I knew you'd like it when you'd tried it once. But it took
my birthday to make you willing to celebrate this way."</p>

<p>"Just you wait till you see what I have for you at home! I
made it all myself, with a little help from Ruth!"</p>

<p>"Oh, Bob, is that what you've been doing all these evenings?
I'm so anxious to see it! I've begrudged the time you've
spent all alone hammering and sawing away down in the basement,
but I didn't let myself even wonder what it was you were
making, since you had asked me not to look."</p>

<p>"Well, while you're beginning the breakfast, I'll be bringing
your birthday gift upstairs. Then I can help you."</p>

<p>In a short time, when Bettina was arranging the cheerful
hollyhocks on the table, she heard a low whistle behind her.
There stood Bob&mdash;looking like a sandwich-man, with a brightly
flowered cretonne screen draped about him.</p>

<p>"Well, how do you like it?"</p>

<p>"Oh, Bob, it's the sewing-screen I've been wanting, and it
just matches the cretonne bedroom hangings! Here are the
little pockets for mending and darning materials&mdash;and the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_47" id="Page_47">[47]</a></span>
larger ones for the unfinished work! How beautifully it is
made&mdash;and won't it be convenient! It will be useful as a
screen, and also as a place for those sewing things, for I have
no good place at all in which to keep them! It will be decorative,
too! And how light it is! I can carry it so easily, and
work beside it on the porch or in the living room!"</p>

<p>"Glad you like it! Ruth designed it, and made the pockets.
I did the carpenter work."</p>

<p>"Bob, it's a lovely birthday gift, and I appreciate it all the
more because you made it yourself. How pretty it is with all
the woodwork enameled white!"</p>

<p>"I wanted it to match the bedroom things. Well, is that
coffee done yet? Tennis certainly does give me an appetite!"</p>

<p>Breakfast consisted of:</p>

<div class='menu'>

<div class='bettina'>BETTINA'S RECIPES</div>

<div class='level'>(All measurements are level)</div>


<div class='recipetitle'><b>Poached Eggs</b> (Two portions)</div>

<div class='ingredients1'>
2 eggs<br />
1 <abbr title="teaspoon">t</abbr>-butter<br />
1 <abbr title="teaspoon">t</abbr>-salt<br />
1 pt. water, boiling<br />
</div>

<p>Butter the bottom of a saucepan or frying-pan. Fill half
full of boiling water. Break the eggs one at a time in a sauce
dish, and slip them very gently into the pan of boiling water.
The eggs will lower the temperature of the water to a point
below the boiling point. Keep the water at this point (below
boiling). Allow the eggs to remain in the water four to six
minutes, or until the desired consistency. Remove from the
water with a skimmer and serve on slices of toast which are
hot, buttered, and slightly moistened with water. The proper
length of time for poaching eggs is until a white film has
formed over the yolks and the white is firm. A tin or aluminum
egg poacher is very convenient. When using rings, butter
the rings, fill each compartment with an egg, and dip into
the boiling water. These are inexpensive, and economical, as
no part of the egg is wasted.</p><p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_48" id="Page_48">[48]</a></span></p>


<div class='recipetitle'><b>Toast</b> (Four Pieces)</div>

<div class='ingredients1'>
4 slices bread<br />
2 <abbr title="tablespoon">T</abbr>-butter<br />
</div>

<p>Toast slices of bread one-half an inch thick on the broiler
directly under the flame, or on a toaster fitted for a burner on
top of the stove. Brown on one side, then turn and brown on
the other. When both sides are an even golden brown, butter
one side, care being taken to butter the edges. Set the toast
on an enamel plate or tin pie-pan in the oven, until all the
pieces are ready for serving. Always serve toast very hot.</p>


<div class='recipetitle'><b>Apple Sauce</b> (Two portions)</div>

<h2>CHAPTER XII</h2>

<div class='chaptertitle'>BETTINA'S FATHER TRIES HER COOKING</div>


<div class='cap'>"SO she is about to try her cooking on me, is she?" said
Bettina's father to Bob, as he sat down at the table.
"Well, I'll admit that I have looked forward to this all day.
But there was a time when I was a little more skeptical of Bettina's
culinary skill. You know, when mother was in California
two years ago last winter&mdash;&mdash;"</div>

<p>"Now, Charlie, you know that all girls have to learn at some
time or other," interrupted Bettina's mother. "And I believe
that Bob has fared pretty well, considering that Bettina is just
beginning to keep house&mdash;&mdash;"</p>

<p>"I should say so!" said Bob, heartily. "Why, I'm getting
fat! I was weighed to-day, and&mdash;&mdash;"</p>

<p>"Don't say any more, Bob! We'll rent the house and take
to boarding! If you get fat&mdash;&mdash;"</p>

<p>"No boarding-houses for mine! Not after your cooking,
Bettina! I had enough of boarding before I was married.
Say&mdash;how long ago that does seem."</p>

<p>"Has the time dragged as much as that? Well, I'll change
the subject. Dad, how do you like my Japanese garden? I
think it's pretty, don't you?"</p>

<p>"I certainly do, my dear. What are those feathery things?"</p>

<p>"Why, don't you know that, Father? And when you were
a boy, you worked on a farm one summer, too! There's a
parsnip and a horse radish, and a beet. Then there are a few
parsley seeds and grass seeds on a tiny sponge! And see the
little shells and stones that Bob and I collected for it."</p>

<p>"Yes, we found that pink stone up the river on a picnic a<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_50" id="Page_50">[50]</a></span>
year ago last May, before we were engaged, or were we engaged
then, Bettina? And the purple one&mdash;&mdash;"</p>

<p>"Oh, you needn't reminisce," Bettina interrupted hastily.
"Eat your dinner."</p>

<div class='poem2'>
<i>"Every little stone<br />
<span style="margin-left: 0.5em;">Has a meaning all its own,</span><br />
<span style="margin-left: 0.5em;">Every little shell&mdash;&mdash;</span><br />
<span style="margin-left: 0.5em;">But it wouldn't do to tell."</span></i><br />
</div>

<p>"I composed that poem just this minute," said Bob, undisturbed.</p>

<p>"Will you help me get the dessert now, Robert? Are you
ready, Mother? And Father?"</p>

<p>"Yes, indeed. A very fine dinner, Bettina. We never have
steak fixed this way at home; do we, Mother? Can we try it
some day soon?"</p>

<p>"I have something for dessert that you like, Dad. Guess
what!"</p>

<p>"What is it? Oh, lemon pie! That is fine, I can tell you!
But I know already that it won't be as good as your mother's!
Still, we'll try it and see!"</p>

the butter, cut the flank steak into pieces three by two inches.
Dredge these lightly in one tablespoon flour and sauté in the
butter until well browned. Remove the meat from the frying-pan;
add the salt, pepper, paprika, mustard, vinegar and flour.
Mix all together and add the water slowly. Replace the steak
in the pan, cover closely and simmer one hour, or until the
steak is tender. Serve on a warm platter and pour the gravy
over it.</p>

<p>Cut the lard into the flour and salt with a knife. Add the
water gradually, lifting with a knife that portion that was
moistened first and pushing it to one side of the bowl, wet another
portion and continue until all is moistened, using just
enough water to hold together. Put together and place on a

firmly into the bottom of the pan. Prick the sides and bottom
with a fork. Crinkle the edges of the crust; have the crust extend
above the edge of the pan to make a deep shell for the
filling. Bake the crust first to make it more crisp. Do not
butter the pan. Bake from five to six minutes in a hot oven.

<div class='chaptertitle'>BOB HELPS WITH THE DINNER</div>


<div class='cap'>"HERE, Bettina, let me mash those potatoes! It's fine
exercise after a day at the office!" And Bob seized
the potato masher with the same vigor that he used to handle
a tennis racquet.</div>

<p>"Good for you, Bob! They can't have a single lump in them
after that! About the most unappetizing thing I can think of
is lumpy mashed potato, or mashed potato that is heavy and
unseasoned. More milk? You'd better use plenty. Here!
Now watch me toss them lightly into this hot dish and put a
little parsley and a lump of butter on the top. There, doesn't
that look delicious?"</p>

<p>"I should say so! And look at the fancy tomatoes, each one
with a cover! What on earth is inside?"</p>

<p>"Just wait till you taste them; they're a new invention of
mine, and I do believe they'll make a splendid luncheon dish
for the next time that Ruth is here, or Alice brings her sewing
over. I'm practising on you first, you see, and if you survive
and seem to like them, I may use them for a real company
dish."</p>

<p>"You can't frighten me that way! Creamed chicken?"</p>

<p>"Creamed veal. Don't you remember what we had for dinner
last night? There were two chops left and I made it of
them. I know it is good when made of cold veal roast, but I
had never tried it with cold veal chops&mdash;so again I am experimenting
on you, Bobby!"</p>

<p>"You don't frighten me so easily as that! I've just caught
a glimpse of something that looks like cocoanut cake, and I'll
be happy now, no matter how the rest of the dinner tastes!"</p><p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_54" id="Page_54">[54]</a></span></p>

<p>"There, everything is on, Bob! Let's sit down to dinner,
and you tell me all about your day!"</p>

<div class='recipetitle'><b>Stuffed Tomatoes Bettina</b> (Two portions)</div>

<div class='ingredients2'>
2 firm, good-sized tomatoes<br />

<h2>CHAPTER XIV</h2>

<div class='chaptertitle'>A SUNDAY EVENING TEA</div>


<div class='cap'>"WHAT kind of tea is this?" Ruth inquired one Sunday
evening on the porch.</div>

<p>"Why, this is a mixture of green and black tea," said Bettina.
"I like that better for iced tea than either kind alone."</p>

<p>"I like tea," said Fred, "although perhaps that isn't considered
a manly sentiment in this country. I hope you do too,
Ruth. Nothing seems so cozy to me as tea and toast. And I
like iced tea like this in the summertime. An uncle of mine is
very fond of tea, and has offered to send me some that he considers
particularly fine. I believe that Orange Pekoe is his
favorite."</p>

<p>"I think that has the best flavor of all," said Bettina, "though
just now we are using an English breakfast tea that we like
very much. And the green tea mixed with it for this is Japan
tea."</p>

<p>"I've heard my uncle say that 'Pekoe' means 'white hair,'
and is applied to young leaves because they are covered with a
fine white down. Uncle also says that black teas are considered
more wholesome than green because they contain less tannin.
I tell you, he's a regular connoisseur."</p>

<p>"I see that I must become an expert tea-maker!" said Ruth.
"I'm learning something new about Fred every day. Bettina,
do tell me exactly how you make tea. Fred can listen, too, unless
he already knows."</p>

<p>"Well, let's see, Ruth. I take a level teaspoonful of tea to a
cup of water. I put the tea in a scalded earthenware tea-pot&mdash;that
kind is better than metal&mdash;and pour boiling water over it&mdash;fresh<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_57" id="Page_57">[57]</a></span>
water. Then I cover it and allow it to steep from three
to five minutes. Then I strain and serve it. You know tea
should always be freshly made, and never warmed over. It
shouldn't be boiled either, not a second. Boiling, or too long
steeping, brings out the tannin."</p>

<p>"But how about iced-tea? That has to stand."</p>

<p>"It shouldn't steep, though. I make it just like any tea and
strain it. Then I let it cool, and set it on the ice for three or
four hours. I serve it with chipped ice, lemon and mint."</p>

<p>"Mother always added a cherry to her afternoon tea," said
Ruth.</p>

<p>"That would be great," said Bob. "I don't care much for
hot tea, but I believe I would be willing to drink a cup for the
sake of the cherry."</p>

<p>"Ruth," said Bettina, "I know now what I will give you for
an engagement present since Fred likes tea, too. A silver tea-ball.
Surely that will symbolize comfort and fireside cheer."</p>

<p>"Speaking of firesides," asked Bob, "what material have you
decided upon for your fireplace? It seems to me that we're
talking too much about tea-making, and not enough about
house-building."</p>

<p>That evening Bettina served:</p>

<div class='menu'>
Salmon Salad with Jellied Vegetables<br />
Boston Brown Bread Sandwiches<br />
Sliced Fresh Peaches<br />

</div>


<div class='bettina'>BETTINA'S RECIPES</div>

<div class='level'>(All measurements are level)</div>


<div class='recipetitle'><b>Salmon Salad with Jellied Vegetables</b> (Four portions)</div>

<div class='ingredients2'>
1 <abbr title="cup">C</abbr>-cooked mixed diced vegetables (string beans, carrots, peas or celery)<br />
1 <abbr title="cup">C</abbr>-meat stock or water (hot)<br />
2 <abbr title="teaspoon">t</abbr>-granulated gelatin<br />
1 <abbr title="teaspoon">t</abbr>-salt<br />

1 <abbr title="teaspoon">t</abbr>-lemon juice<br />
</div><p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_58" id="Page_58">[58]</a></span></p>

<p>Cooked vegetables may be combined for this salad. Soak
the gelatin in cold water a few minutes, add the meat stock
or water and stir until the gelatin is thoroughly dissolved. If
it is not completely dissolved, heat over a pan of hot water.
Add the vegetables in such proportions as desired or convenient.
Add the salt, lemon juice and pimento; turn the mixture
into a moistened mould. (A ring mould is attractive.)
Allow to stand for one hour or more in a cold place. When
ready to serve, remove from mould to a chilled plate. If a
ringed mould is used, the center may be filled with flaked salmon
over which salad dressing has been poured. If the vegetable
part is used as a salad, salad dressing may be placed
around the vegetables.</p>


<div class='recipetitle'><b>One Egg Cake</b> (Ten portions)</div>

4 <abbr title="tablespoon">T</abbr>-butter<br />

</div>

<p>Cream the butter, add the sugar gradually, and the egg well
beaten. Mix and sift the flour and baking powder and add
alternately with the milk. Add the vanilla. Bake in a loaf-cake
pan twenty-five minutes in a moderate oven.</p>


<div class='recipetitle'><b>Chocolate Icing for Cake</b></div>

amount. Spread on the cake.</p><hr class="chap" /><p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_59" id="Page_59">[59]</a></span></p>




<h2>CHAPTER XV</h2>

<div class='chaptertitle'>A MOTOR PICNIC</div>


<div class='cap'>"HELLO, Bettina; this is Bob. What are you having for
dinner to-night?"</div>

<p>"It's all in the fireless cooker! Why?"</p>

<p>"Couldn't you manage to make a picnic supper of it? One
of the men at the office has invited us to go motoring to-night
with him and his wife, and, of course, I said we'd be delighted.
They're boarding, poor things, and I asked if we couldn't
bring the supper. He seemed glad to have me suggest it. I
suppose he hasn't had any home cooking for months. Do you
suppose you could manage the lunch? How about it?"</p>

<p>"Why, let me think! How soon must we start?"</p>

<p>"We'll be there in an hour or a little less. Don't bother about
it&mdash;get anything you happen to have."</p>

<p>"It's fine to go, dear. Of course, I'll be ready. Good-bye!"</p>

<p>Bettina's brain was busy. There was a veal loaf baking in
one compartment of the cooker, and on the other side, some
Boston brown bread was steaming. Her potatoes were cooked
already for creaming, and although old potatoes would have
been better for the purpose, she might make a salad of them.
As she hastily put on some eggs to hard-cook, she inspected her
ice box. Yes, those cold green beans, left from last night's
dinner, would be good in the salad. What else? "It needs
something to give it character," she reflected. "A little canned
pimento&mdash;and, yes&mdash;a few of the pickles in that jar."</p>

<p>Of course, she had salad dressing&mdash;she was never without
it. Sandwiches? The brown bread would be too fresh and
soft for sandwiches, but she could keep it hot, and take some<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_60" id="Page_60">[60]</a></span>
butter along. "I'm glad it is cool to-day. We'll need hot
coffee in the thermos bottle, and I can make it a warm supper&mdash;except
for the salad."</p>

<p>She took the veal loaf and the steamed brown bread from
the cooker, and put them into the oven to finish cooking.</p>

<p>"How lucky it is that I made those Spanish buns! And the
bananas that were to have been sliced for dessert, I can just
take along whole."</p>

<p>When Bettina heard the auto horn, and then Bob's voice, she
was putting on her hat.</p>

<p>"Well, Betty, could you manage it?"</p>

<p>"Yes, indeed, dear. Everything is ready. The thermos bottle
has coffee in it, piping hot; the lunch basket over there is
packed with the warm things wrapped tight, and that pail with
the burlap over it is a temporary ice box. It holds a piece of
ice, and beside it is the cream for the coffee and the potato
salad. It is cool to-day, but I thought it best to pack them that
way."</p>

<p>"You are the best little housekeeper in this town," said Bob
as he kissed her. "I don't believe anyone else could have managed
a picnic supper on such short notice. Come on out and
meet Mr. and Mrs. Dixon. May I tell them that they have a
fine spread coming?"</p>

<p>"Don't you dare, sir. It's a very ordinary kind of a supper,
and even you are apt to be disappointed."</p>

<p>But he wasn't.</p>

<p>Bettina's picnic supper that cool day consisted of:</p>

<div class='menu'>
Warm Veal Loaf&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;Cold Potato Salad<br />

Hot Coffee<br />
</div>


<div class='bettina'>BETTINA'S RECIPES</div>

<div class='level'>(All measurements are level)</div>


<div class='recipetitle'><b>Veal Loaf</b> (Six to eight portions)</div>

<div class='ingredients1'>
2 lbs. lean veal<br />
½ <abbr title="pound">lb.</abbr> salt pork<br />
6 large crackers<br />
2 <abbr title="tablespoon">T</abbr>-lemon juice<br />
4 <abbr title="teaspoon">t</abbr>-onion salt<br />
1 <abbr title="tablespoon">T</abbr>-salt<br />
½ <abbr title="teaspoon">t</abbr>-pepper<br />
4 <abbr title="tablespoon">T</abbr>-cream<br />
</div><p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_61" id="Page_61">[61]</a></span></p>

<p>Put two crackers in the meat grinder, add bits of meat and
pork and the rest of the crackers. The crackers first and last
prevent the pork and meat from sticking to the grinder. Add
other ingredients in order named. Pack in a well-buttered
bread-pan. Smooth evenly on top, brush with white of an egg
and bake one hour in a moderate oven. Baste frequently. The
meat may be cooked in a fireless cooker between two stones. It
is perfectly satisfactory cooked this way, and requires no
basting.</p>


<div class='recipetitle'><b>Boston Brown Bread</b> (Six portions)</div>

<div class='ingredients1'>
1 <abbr title="cup">C</abbr>-rye or graham flour<br />
1 <abbr title="cup">C</abbr>-cornmeal<br />
1 <abbr title="cup">C</abbr>-white flour<br />
1 <abbr title="teaspoon">t</abbr>-salt<br />
1½ <abbr title="teaspoon">t</abbr>-soda<br />
¾ <abbr title="cup">C</abbr>-molasses<br />
¼ <abbr title="cup">C</abbr>-sugar<br />
1½ <abbr title="cup">C</abbr>-sour milk or 1¼ <abbr title="cup">C</abbr>-sweet<br />
milk or water<br />
<span class='small'><sup>2</sup>/<sub>3</sub></span> <abbr title="cup">C</abbr>-raisins<br />
</div>

<p>Mix and sift dry ingredients, add molasses and liquid. Fill
well-buttered moulds two-thirds full, butter the top of mould,
and steam three and one-half hours. Remove from moulds
and place in an oven to dry ten minutes before serving. 1&mdash;If
sweet milk is used, 1 <abbr title="tablespoon">T</abbr>-vinegar to 1¼ C will sour the milk.
2&mdash;Baking powder cans, melon moulds, lard pails or any attractively
shaped tin cans may be used as a mould. 3&mdash;Two
methods of steaming are used: (a) Regular steamer in which
the mould, either large or individual, is placed over a pan of
boiling water. Buttered papers may be tied firmly over the
tops of uncovered moulds. (b) Steaming in boiling water.
The mould is placed on a small article in the bottom of a pan
of boiling water. This enables the water to circulate around
the mould. Care must be observed in keeping the kettle two-thirds
full of boiling water all of the time of cooking. (Bettina
used the method in the fireless cooker.) She started
the brown bread in the cooker utensil on the top of the stove.
When the water was boiling vigorously, she placed it over one
hot stone in the cooker. The water came two-thirds of the distance
to the top of her cans. In the cooker, she did not have to
watch for fear the water would boil away. After fastening
the lid tightly on the cooker-kettle in which the bread was to
steam, she did not look at it again for four hours. (It takes
a little longer in the cooker than on the stove.)</p><hr class="chap" /><p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_62" id="Page_62">[62]</a></span></p>




<h2>CHAPTER XVI</h2>

<div class='chaptertitle'>BETTINA HAS A CALLER</div>


<div class='cap'>THE next morning Bettina was alone in her little kitchen
when the door bell rang.</div>

<p>"Why, Mrs. Dixon; how do you do?" she said, as she
opened the door and recognized the visitor. "Won't you come
in?"</p>

<p>It must be admitted that Bettina was somewhat embarrassed
at the unexpected call at so unconventional a time. Mrs. Dixon
was dressed in a trim street costume, but under her veil Bettina
could see that her eyes were red, and her lips quivered as
she answered:</p>

<p>"Forgive me for coming so early, but I just had to. I know
you'll think me silly to talk to you confidentially when I met
you only yesterday, but I do want your advice about something.
You mustn't stop what you are doing. Couldn't I come
into the kitchen and talk while you work?"</p>

<p>"Why, my dear, of course you can," said Bettina, trying to
put her at her ease. "You can't guess what I was doing! I
was washing my pongee dress; someone told me of such a
good way!"</p>

<p>"Why, could you do it all yourself?" said Mrs. Dixon, opening
her eyes wide. "Why not send it to be dry-cleaned?"</p>

<p>"Of course I might," said Bettina, "but it would be expensive,
and I do like to save a little money every month from
my housekeeping allowance. There are always so many things
I want to get. You see I'm doing this in luke-warm, soapy
water&mdash;throwing the soap-suds up over the goods, then I'll
rinse it well, and hang it in the shade to drip until it gets dry.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_63" id="Page_63">[63]</a></span>
I won't press it till it is fully dry, because if I do, it will be
spotted."</p>

<p>"How do you learn things like that?"</p>

<p>"Oh, since I've been married, and even before, when I
thought about keeping house, I began to pick up all sorts of
good ideas. I like economizing; it gives me an opportunity
to use all the ingenuity I have."</p>

<p>"Does it? I always thought it would be awfully tiresome.
You see, I've lived in a hotel all my life; my mother never
was strong, and I was the only child. I liked it, and since I've
been married, we've lived the same way. I never thought of
anything else and I supposed Frank would like it, too&mdash;but
lately&mdash;oh, all the last year&mdash;he's been begging me to let him
find us a house. And then"&mdash;(Bettina saw that her eyes had
filled with tears)&mdash;"he has been so different. You have no idea,
my dear. Why&mdash;he hasn't been at home with me two evenings
a week&mdash;and&mdash;&mdash;"</p>

<p>"You must be dreadfully unhappy," interrupted Bettina,
wondering what she could say, since she disliked particularly
to listen to any account of domestic difficulties. "But why not
try keeping house? Maybe that would be better. Why, Bob
doesn't like to be away from home any evenings at all."</p>

<p>"But you've just been married!" said Mrs. Dixon, tactlessly.
"Wait and see how he'll be after a few years!"</p>

<p>"Well, that's all the more reason for trying to make him like
his home. Have you thought of taking a house?"</p>

<p>"That was just the reason I came to you. You seem to be
so happy living this way&mdash;and it surprised me. I knew last
evening what Frank was thinking when he saw this little house&mdash;and
then when you unpacked the lunch&mdash;tell me honestly,
did you cook it yourself?"</p>

<p>"Of course," said Bettina, smiling.</p>

<p>"Wasn't it hard to learn? Why, I can't cook a thing&mdash;I can't
even make coffee! Frank says if he could only have one breakfast
that was fit to eat&mdash;&mdash;" and she buried her face in her
handkerchief.</p>

<p>"Why, Mrs. Dixon!" cried Bettina, cheerfully, though her
heart was beating furiously. "Your trouble is the easiest one<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_64" id="Page_64">[64]</a></span>
in the world to remedy! Your husband is just hungry&mdash;that's
all! I'll tell you&mdash;we'll make this a little secret between us, and
have such fun over it! You do just as I tell you for one
month and I'll guarantee that Frank will be at home every single
minute that he can!"</p>

<p>"Do you suppose I can learn?"</p>

<p>"I'll show you every single thing. We'll slip out this very
day and look for a little house&mdash;to surprise Frank! And I'll
teach you to cook by easy stages!"</p>

<p>"Oh, will you?" smiled Mrs. Dixon, showing an adorable
dimple in her round cheek. "You don't know how much better
I feel already! When can we begin?"</p>

<p>"Right now&mdash;with coffee&mdash;real, sure 'nough coffee that will
make Frank's eyes stick out! Have you a percolator?"</p>

<p>"No, but I can get one."</p>

<p>"It isn't necessary at all. I'll tell you how to do without it,
and then using one will be perfectly simple."</p>

<h2>CHAPTER XVII</h2>

<div class='chaptertitle'>BOB GETS BREAKFAST ON SUNDAY</div>


<div class='cap'>"NOW, Bettina, you sit here and direct me, but don't you
dare to move. I'm going to get breakfast myself."</div>

<p>"Fine for you, chef! Have it on the porch, will you? It's
the most beautiful morning of the year, I do believe! But
you must give me something to do. Let me set the table, will
you?"</p>

<p>"Well, you can do that, but get me an apron first. Be sure
you get one that'll be becoming!"</p>

<p>Bettina went to a deep drawer in the pantry, of which the
breakfast alcove was a part, and selected a white bungalow
apron with red dots.</p>

<p>"Here, put your arms through this! There, how 'chic' you
look! Bob, do you realize that this is our first breakfast on
the porch? I must get some of those feathery things growing
out there; I want them for the table. We must celebrate!"</p>

<p>"If having flowers on the table is celebrating, you celebrate
every day!"</p>

<p>"Of course, my dear! Our married life is just one long
celebration. Haven't you discovered that yet?"</p>

<p>Bettina had thus far no flower garden, but she was never
without flowers. The weeds and grasses in her backyard had
a way of turning themselves into charming centerpieces, and
then, too, red clover was always plentiful.</p>

<p>Bob moved the coffee percolator and the electric toaster to
the porch and attached them while Bettina spread the luncheon
cloth upon the small table. "Aren't you glad we thought to<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_66" id="Page_66">[66]</a></span>
plan it so that we might have the percolator and the toaster
out here?" she said. "That was your idea, wasn't it?"</p>

<p>"Aren't you glad you married me?" said Bob enthusiastically.
"I'll bet I'm the only man on this street who can frizzle
dried beef and cream it! And make coffee!"</p>

<p>"Who taught you that, I'd like to know? Give some credit
to your wife who forces you to do it! Here, Bridget! The
grapefruit is in the ice box; did you see it? And the oatmeal
in the cooker is waiting to be reheated. Set it in a kettle of
water over the fire, so that it won't burn. There are rolls in
the bread-box. Put them in the oven a minute to warm up.
If they seem dry, dip them quickly in water before heating
them. Now shall I be making some toast-rounds for the chipped
beef?"</p>

<p>"Well, you might be doing that. I'm getting dizzy with all
these orders, ma'am. You can hunt up the cream and the milk
and the butter, too, if you will. Now for the beef! Say, but
this is going to be a good breakfast! 'Befoh de wah' I used
to sleep late on Sundays, but not any more for me! I like to
cook!"</p>

<p>"There's someone at the door. I'll go; you're busier than I
am."</p>

<p>There on the doorstep beside the Sunday paper stood a little
four-year-old neighbor, her hands full of old-fashioned pinks.</p>

<p>"My mother sent these to you," she said.</p>

<p>"Oh, lovely, dear! Thank you! Won't you come in?"</p>

<p>"No'm! My daddy has to shine my shoes for Sunday
school."</p>

<p>"Bob, aren't these pretty with the white feathery weeds? I
do love flowers!"</p>

<p>"They don't look half so pretty as this 'ere frizzled beef
does! Breakfast is all ready!"</p>

<p>Bettina sat down to an open-air breakfast of</p>

<div class='menu'>

</div><p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_67" id="Page_67">[67]</a></span></p>

<p>After a jolly and leisurely meal, Bob announced that he was
ready to wash the dishes.</p>

<p>"Ever since I've seen that nice white-lined dishpan of yours,
I've wanted to try it. It's oval, and I never saw an oval one
before."</p>

<p>"I like it because it fits into the sink so well, and fills all the
space it can."</p>

<p>"See how efficient I am! I put on the water for the dishes
when we sat down to eat! Now I'll have nice hot, soapy
water, and lots of it, to rinse them!"</p>

<p>"But don't rinse the glasses, dear. See how I can polish
glass and silver that has just come out of that clean soapy
water! Look! Isn't that shiny and pretty? There, you can
scald everything else!"</p>

<p>"There's the telephone! It's Mrs. Dixon! What on earth
can she want? She asked for you!"</p>

<p>Bettina talked for a few moments in monosyllables and then
returned to the dishes. "What did she have to say?" Bob
asked.</p>

<p>"She asked me not to tell you, Bob. Nothing much. Perhaps
you'll know some day."</p>

<p>Bob looked puzzled and slightly hurt. It was the first time
that Bettina had kept anything from him and he could not help
showing some displeasure.</p>

<p>Bettina saw this, and said: "Bob, I don't want to have any
secret from you, and I'd like you to know that this is nothing
that I wouldn't tell you gladly if I were the only one concerned.
I promised, that's all. You'll smile when you know
all about it."</p>

<p>And Bob was mollified.</p>

<h2>CHAPTER XVIII</h2>

<div class='chaptertitle'>BETTINA GIVES A PORCH PARTY</div>


<div class='cap'>"I'M so glad that you girls have come, for I've been longing
to show you the porch ever since Bob and I put on
the finishing touches."</div>

<p>"O Bettina, it's lovely!" cried all the guests in a chorus.
"But weren't you awfully extravagant?"</p>

<p>"Wait till I tell you. Perhaps I ought not to give myself
away, but I am prouder of our little economies than of anything
else; we've had such fun over them. This is some old
wicker furniture that Mother had in her attic, all but this
chair, that came from Aunt Nell's. Bob mended it very carefully,
and then enameled it this dull green color. I have been
busy with these cretonne hangings and cushions for a long
time, and we have been coaxing along the flowers in our hanging
baskets and our window boxes for days and days, so that
they would make a good impression on our first porch guests.
Bob made the flower boxes himself and enameled them to go
with the furniture. This high wicker flower box was a wedding
gift, and so was the wicker reading lamp. This matting
rug is new, but I must admit that we bought nothing else except
this drop-leaf table, which I have been wanting for a long
time. You see it will make a good serving table, and then
we expect to eat on it in warm weather."</p>

<p>"What are we to make today, Bettina? The invitation has
made us all curious.</p>

<div class='poem'>
"'The porch is cool as cool can be,<br />
<span style="margin-left: 0.5em;">So come on Thursday just at three,</span><br />
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_70" id="Page_70">[70]</a></span><span style="margin-left: 1.5em;">To stay awhile and sew</span><br />
<span style="margin-left: 0.5em;">On something useful, strong, and neat,</span><br />
<span style="margin-left: 1.5em;">Which, with your help, will quite complete</span><br />
<span style="margin-left: 0.5em;">Bettina's bungalow!'"</span><br />
</div>

<p>"What about the little sketches of knives and forks and
spoons in the corners?"</p>

<p>"Bob did that. He wrote the verse, too, or I'm afraid I
should have telephoned. Are we all here? Wait a minute."</p>

<p>And Bettina wheeled out her tea-cart, on which, among trailing
nasturtiums, were mysterious packages wrapped in fringed
green tissue paper.</p>

<p>"What is in them? Silver cases&mdash;cut and ready to be made!
Oh, how cunning! Shall we label them, too? What is the
card?</p>

<div class='poem'>
"'I'll not incase your silver speech,<br />
<span style="margin-left: 0.5em;">For that is quite beyond my reach!'"</span><br />
</div>

<p>"Did Bob do that, too? The impudence!" and Ruth threaded
her needle in preparation.</p>

<p>"You see," said Bettina, "I hadn't found time to make cases
for my silver, so I just decided to let you girls help me! The
card tells what to label them, in outline stitch in these bright
colors. I used to open ten cases at home before I found what
I wanted, so I am insuring against that."</p>

<p>Talk and laughter shortened the afternoon, but at five o'clock
Bettina wheeled out her tea-cart again. The dainty luncheon
was decorated with nasturtiums. The girls laid aside their
work while Bettina served:</p>

<div class='menu'>

</div>


<div class='bettina'>BETTINA'S RECIPES</div>

<div class='level'>(All measurements are level)</div>


<div class='recipetitle'><b>Sunbonnet Baby Salad</b> (Ten portions)</div>

<div class='ingredients1'>
10 halves pears<br />
20 cloves, whole<br />
20 almonds<br />
10 thin slices pimento<br />
10 <abbr title="tablespoon">T</abbr>-salad dressing<br />
10 pieces lettuce<br />
</div><p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_71" id="Page_71">[71]</a></span></p>

<p>Arrange the halves of canned pears, round side up, on
lettuce leaves, which curl closely about the pear and have the
effect of a hood. Place cloves in the pear for eyes, blanched
almonds for ears, and slip thin slices of canned pimento into
cuts made for nose and mouth. The expressions may be varied.
Put salad dressing around the outside of the pear to represent
hair and arrange a bow of red pimento under the chin of
the sunbonnet baby. These salads are very effective and easy
to make.</p>


<div class='recipetitle'><b>Nut Bread</b> (Twenty-four sandwiches)</div>

<div class='ingredients1'>
1½ <abbr title="cup">C</abbr>-graham flour<br />

<span class='small'><sup>2</sup>/<sub>3</sub></span> <abbr title="cup">C</abbr>-chopped nut meats, dates or raisins<br />

<p>Sift together all the dry ingredients, add the nut meats and
fruit. Add the milk. Stir well, and pour into two well-buttered
loaf pans. Allow to stand and rise for twenty minutes.
Bake three-fourths of an hour in a moderate oven. Use
bread twenty-four hours old for the sandwiches. "C" sugar is
light brown sugar and gives food a delicious flavor.</p>


<div class='recipetitle'><b>Lemon Sherbet</b> (Ten portions)</div>

<div class='ingredients1'>
4 <abbr title="cup">C</abbr>-water<br />
2 <abbr title="cup">C</abbr>-sugar<br />

</div>

<p>Boil sugar and water ten minutes. Cool, add lemon juice
and strain. Freeze, and when nearly stiff, add beaten egg
white and finish freezing.</p>

½ <abbr title="teaspoon">t</abbr>-lemon extract<br />
</div>

<p>Boil the sugar and water without stirring until it threads
when dropped from the spoon. Pour slowly into the whites
of the eggs beaten stiffly. Beat until it holds its shape. Add
the flavoring and spread on the cake.</p>


<div class='recipetitle'><b>Bettina's Suggestions</b></div>

<p>Arrange the sunbonnet babies on a salad platter, and let the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_72" id="Page_72">[72]</a></span>
guests help themselves. The salad is light and attractive. The
stem end of the pear represents the neck. Cream the butter
to be used for sandwiches. It spreads more evenly and goes
farther. Sandwiches taste better if allowed to stand for several
hours, wrapped securely in a napkin which has been well
dampened (not wet). Cut the slices very thin and press together
firmly. Cut into fancy shapes.</p><hr class="chap" /><p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_73" id="Page_73">[73]</a></span></p>




<h2>CHAPTER XIX</h2>

<div class='chaptertitle'>BETTINA AND THE EXPENSE BUDGET</div>


<div class='cap'>"RUTH asked me today how we manage our finances,"
said Bettina over the dinner table. "She said that she
and Fred were wondering what plan was best. I'm so glad I
have a definite household allowance and that we have budgeted
our expenses so successfully. The other day I was reading an
article by Carolyn Claymore in which she says that three-fourths
of the domestic troubles are caused by disagreements
about money."</div>

<p>"Then we haven't much to quarrel about, have we, Betty?
That is true in more than one sense. But I'm sure that this
way seems to suit us to a T."</p>

<p>"I'm even saving money, Bob."</p>

<p>"I don't see how you can when you give me such good
things to eat, and when we have so much company."</p>

<p>"Well, I plan ahead, you know&mdash;plan for my left-overs before
they are left, even. I do think that an instinct for buying
and planning is better than an instinct for cooking. And either
one can be cultivated. But it was certainly hard to get that
budget of expenses fixed satisfactorily, wasn't it? I told Ruth
that no two families are alike, and that I couldn't tell her just
what they ought to spend for clothes, or just what groceries
ought to cost. After all, it is an individual matter which
things are necessities and which are luxuries. The chief thing
is to live within your means, and save as well as invest something&mdash;and
at the same time be comfortable and happy. I told
Ruth we started with the fixed sums and the absolute necessities,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_74" id="Page_74">[74]</a></span>
and worked backward. I told her they must absolutely
be saving something, if only a quarter a week. Then, that
Fred must manage the budget of expenses that comes within
his realm, and not interfere with hers, and that she must do
the same with the household expenditures, and not worry him.
It takes a lot of adjusting to make the system work satisfactorily,
but it is certainly worth it."</p>

<p>"Did you tell Ruth about the envelope system that my sister
Harriet, uses? She says she is so careless naturally that when
George gives her her allowance each month, she has to put the
actual cash in separate envelopes, and then vow to herself that
she will not borrow from the gas money to make the change
for the grocer-boy, and so forth. That is the only way she
can teach herself."</p>

<p>"My cousin's wife used to keep the most wonderful and
complete accounts, but she couldn't tell without a lot of work
in hunting up the items how much she already had spent for
groceries or clothes or anything. She had to change her
method, and it was she who taught me to keep my accounts in
parallel columns, a page for a week, because you give me my
allowance each week. I like this way so much, for I can tell
at a glance how my expenses are comparing with the allotted
sum."</p>

<p>"I like to look at your funny, neat little notebook, Bettina,
all ruled so carefully for the week, and the headings, such as
gas, electricity, groceries, meat, milk, laundry, across the top."</p>

<p>"Don't make fun of my notebook. I couldn't keep house
without it. In case of fire, I'd save it first of all, I know! It
is almost like a diary to me! I can look back over it and
remember, 'That was the day Bob brought Mr. Green home
and we almost ran out of potatoes!' Or 'This was the day I
thought my brown bread had failed, but Bob seemed to like
it!'" she exaggerated.</p>

<p>"Failures in cooking! Why, Bettina, I don't know the meaning
of the words! And I don't see how you can feed me so
well on the sum I give you for the purpose. I'd feel guilty,
only you don't look a bit unhappy or overworked."</p>

<p>"I should say not!"</p><p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_75" id="Page_75">[75]</a></span></p>

<p>"You surely don't remember how to cook all the things you
give me!"</p>

<p>"No, indeed, Bob, not definitely, that is. You see, on the
shelf by my account book, which you smile over, I have my
card index with lots and lots of recipes filed away. Then I
have notebooks, too, with all sorts of suggestions tucked in
them just where I can lay my hand on them."</p>

<p>"Betty dear, you've given me a real glimpse into your business-like
methods! Some men seem to think that it doesn't
take brains to run a house well, but they don't know. It requires
just as much executive ability and common sense as it
does to manage a big business."</p>

<p>That night the dinner for two consisted of:</p>

<h2>CHAPTER XX</h2>

<div class='chaptertitle'>MRS. DIXON AND BETTINA'S EXPERIMENT</div>


<div class='cap'>"I'M so happy!" said Mrs. Dixon, as she stopped at Bettina's
door one cool morning. "But I'm nervous, too!
What if Frank shouldn't like it?"</div>

<p>"Oh, but he will!" Bettina assured her. "He'll think he's
the luckiest man in town, and I almost believe that he is! He'll
love that dear little white house with the screened porch! Why,
the very grass looks as if it longed to spell 'Welcome' like
some of the door mats I've seen! And think of the flower
boxes! You were very fortunate to rent it for a year, furnished
so nicely, and probably when that time is up you'll be
ready to build or buy one of your own."</p>

<p>"You are a dear to cheer me up this way, but I'm nervous in
spite of you. Perhaps I should have consulted Frank before
I promised to take the house."</p>

<p>"But he has been urging you to keep house for so long!
And I know he'll be grateful to you for sparing him the worry
of hunting one himself. Besides, he'll like being surprised."</p>

<p>"Well, I'll go back to the hotel for luncheon with him, and
then I'll phone him later to meet me at the house. I won't
tell him a thing; I'll just give him the address. I'll say it's
very, very important. That will surprise him and perhaps will
frighten him a little. He never does leave his office during
business hours, but it will take only a few minutes for him to
run out here in the car. Goodness, I'm forgetting what I came
for! Do you suppose I am too stupid to try to make those
Spanish buns Frank liked so much? We had them at the
picnic, you know. I have three hours after luncheon until he
comes, and I just long to give him some good coffee and some<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_78" id="Page_78">[78]</a></span>
Spanish buns that I've made myself! That little kitchen looks
as if it would be so nice to work in! I tried coffee a little
while ago over at the house, and really&mdash;it was fine! It looked
just like yours! I was so surprised! To think of my doing
such things!"</p>

<p>"Of course you could make Spanish buns; it would be fine
if you would. I'll tell you,&mdash;why not let me come over for an
hour right after luncheon and superintend? Then I'll slip
home so that you can be alone when Frank comes. I could
tell you some other things about cooking while we're there
together,&mdash;things you may write down in your new notebook.
For example, I've often wondered that so few housekeepers
can make good white sauce."</p>

<p>"What in the world is that?"</p>

<p>"It's used in cream soups, and it's the cream part of creamed
vegetables and meat and fish, and then there is a thicker white
sauce that is used to bind croquettes&mdash;that is, hold the ingredients
together. There are really four kinds of white sauces
and they are very simple to make. I think everyone should
know the right way to make them, for they are useful in
preparing so many good things."</p>

<p>"I'm glad we'll be near you because I can ask you so many
questions."</p>

<p>"And I'm glad that it is summer, because you can have so
many things that require little or no cooking, and by fall, I'm
sure you will be an accomplished housekeeper."</p>

<p>"Will you come over at two, then, or earlier if you can?"</p>

<p>"Of course I will!"</p>

<p>And as Mrs. Dixon hurried away Bettina felt a sympathetic
thrill at the happiness two other people were about to find.</p>

<p>Melt the butter in a saucepan and add the flour and salt,
stirring constantly. When well mixed add the liquid, a little
at a time. Bring to a boil, stirring constantly. This is far
better than mixing the flour with a little of the liquid when
cold, as so many people do when creaming potatoes or other
things. If the white sauce seems too thick for the purpose,
thin with a little more liquid before removing from the fire.</p><hr class="chap" /><p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_81" id="Page_81">[81]</a></span></p>




<h2>CHAPTER XXI</h2>

<div class='chaptertitle'>A RAINY-DAY DINNER</div>


<div class='cap'>THE rain had been falling all day in a heavy downpour,
and Bettina had ventured out only to gather some red
clover blooms for the porch table, which she was now setting
for dinner. In spite of the rain, it was not cold, and she liked
the contrast of the cheerful little table, with its white cloth and
bright silver, and the gray day just outside the screen.</div>

<p>"If Bob would only come home early, how nice it would be!"
she thought. "Perhaps that's he at the telephone now."</p>

<p>However, it proved to be Mrs. Dixon. "I phoned to ask
you if I should throw away the yolks of two eggs. I've just
used the whites."</p>

<p>"Oh, no, Mrs. Dixon! Beat them up well, and add a little
cold water to them. Then set them in the ice-box. They
will be just as good later as they would be now. You may
want them for salad dressing or something else."</p>

<p>"If I ever have the white of the egg left, shall I treat that
the same way?"</p>

<p>"No, don't beat that up at all, nor add any water. Just set
it in the refrigerator as it is. I'm so glad you called up, Mrs.
Dixon. Will you and your husband take dinner with us next
Sunday? Perhaps we might all go to church first."</p>

<p>"We'd love to do that! I've just been worrying over Sunday
dinner, and you've restored my peace of mind. But won't
it be a great deal of work for you?"</p>

<p>"I won't let it be. I don't believe in those heavy, elaborate
Sunday dinners that take all the morning to prepare. We'll
just come home from church and have it in half an hour. You
may help me."</p><p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_82" id="Page_82">[82]</a></span></p>

<p>"We'd love to come. I have so much to tell you. I've been
very busy, but Frank has helped, and it has been such fun!
You don't know how he enjoys the little house! Well, good-bye
till tomorrow!"</p>

<p>"Boo!" shouted Bob in her ear, as she hung up the receiver.
"I discovered your dark secret this morning! Frank Dixon
told me!"</p>

<p>"Well, what did you think of it?"</p>

<p>"The only possible solution in that case. You are their good
angel&mdash;that is, if she doesn't poison Frank with her cooking,
or burn the house down when she's lighting the fire."</p>

<p>"She won't, don't worry! She takes to housekeeping as if
she had always done it. Her house is immaculate; she has
been cleaning and dusting and polishing from morning to night.
I'm almost ashamed of mine!"</p>

<p>"I'm not!" said Bob, decidedly. "I don't see how you can
keep it clean at all with a man like me scattering papers and
cigar ashes everywhere. And I'm always losing my belongings,
and always will, I suppose."</p>

<p>"That's only a sign that we haven't discovered the proper
place for them all yet. But we'll work it out in time. Well,
are you hungry?"</p>

<p>"Hungry? I should say so! Why, I could almost eat you!"</p>

<p>"Well, Bob, we have a rainy-day dinner tonight that I hope
you'll enjoy. Hash! Does that frighten you?"</p>

<p>"Not your hash, Betty."</p>

<p>"Well, everything is ready."</p>

<p>The rainy evening menu consisted of:</p>

<h2>CHAPTER XXII</h2>

<div class='chaptertitle'>BUYING A REFRIGERATOR</div>


<div class='cap'>"SOMETHING in refrigerators?" said the clerk politely
to Mrs. Dixon and Bettina.</div>

<p>"You talk to him," said Mrs. Dixon. "I don't know a thing
about a refrigerator; that's why I begged you to come."</p>

<p>"Well," considered Bettina, her red brown head on one
side, "we want one that will hold not less than a hundred
pounds of ice. The large ones are much more economical in
the long run. Here, Mrs. Dixon, is a hundred-pound fellow.
May we examine it, please?"</p>

<p>"Certainly, madam."</p>

<p>"No, this won't do. See, Mrs. Dixon, the trap is in the
bottom of the food chamber. That is wasteful and inconvenient,
because in cleaning it you would have to leave the
door of the larger compartment open. That would let the
cold air out and waste the ice. Anyhow, you know the trap
is the sewer of the refrigerator, and has no business in the food
chamber. The trap really ought to be in the bottom of the ice
chamber, where it can be cleaned without removing the food,
or opening the door of the food compartment. Besides, I
prefer to have the ice put in at a door on the side of the front,
not on the top. Yes, here is the kind I mean. I like this trap,
too. See, Mrs. Dixon, isn't it fine? It has a white enamel
lining and shelves of open wire that can be removed."</p>

<p>"It looks nice, doesn't it? And when I get some white shelf
paper on those shelves it will be like an attractive cupboard."</p>

<p>"Oh, my dear! You mustn't do that! That would prevent
the circulation of air through the ice-box, which is the very<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_85" id="Page_85">[85]</a></span>
thing that makes the food compartment cold. You see, that
circulation of air goes on through these open-wire shelves.
Another thing, I've seen people cover the ice with newspapers
to keep it from melting, as they thought. But they
were mistaken. Any friction causes warmth, and ice keeps
better when there is nothing touching it."</p>

<p>"Well, if you like this one, I'll ask the price of it."</p>

<p>"It will be expensive, I'm afraid, but the most economical in
the long run. Are you staying downtown to meet Mr. Dixon?"</p>

<p>"Yes, I'd like him to see the refrigerator. He takes such an
interest in these household things I'm getting."</p>

<p>"Well, good-bye, dear. I must hurry home to get dinner.
It won't take long, but I'll have to go, or Bob will get there
first, and I'm a little sentimental about being there to greet
him at the door."</p>

<p>Bettina's dinner that night consisted of:</p>

<h2>CHAPTER XXIII</h2>

<div class='chaptertitle'>BETTINA'S SUNDAY DINNER</div>


<div class='cap'>"THIS seems like old times!" remarked Mr. Dixon, as he
and his wife strolled leisurely home from church with
Bob and Bettina. "I haven't had this peaceful Sunday feeling
since I was a youngster. Then all the Sundays were like this,
cool, quiet and sunny&mdash;sprinkled all over with little girls in
smooth curls and white leghorn hats, and little boys in uncomfortable,
hot clothes a size too large, and newly polished shoes.
I often recall the plentiful Sunday dinners, too!"</div>

<p>"Don't get your hopes too high!" said Bettina. "Though I
will promise you one treat, wild roses on the table. Bob and I
walked out into the country last evening and found them."</p>

<p>"What can I do?" inquired Mrs. Dixon, when she and Bettina
were alone in the kitchen.</p>

<p>"You can sit here and talk to me while these potatoes are
cooking and the veal birds getting done. You see, the birds
have already cooked three-quarters of an hour this morning
before I went to church. The waxed beans are in the fireless
cooker; I have to make the butter sauce for them. And you
see I have the new potatoes all prepared, standing in cold
water. I have only to cook them in boiling salted water till
they are done. That won't take long, as they aren't large. I
set the table on the porch this morning. Bob can make the
coffee in the percolator in a little while, when we're ready.
He usually starts it when we come to the table, and then it is
ready in time to serve last. By the way, if you like the Thousand
Island dressing we are to have for the head lettuce, I'd
like to give you the recipe. It is a very popular one just now."</p><p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_88" id="Page_88">[88]</a></span></p>

<p>"Oh, I've eaten it! Frank is very fond of it, and used to
order it every chance he had at the hotel. Will you really
tell me how to make it? So many good dinners now end with
the salad and cheese and coffee, and I think Thousand Island
dressing on head lettuce makes a splendid salad."</p>

<p>"Of course I'll show you. Well, the iced cantaloupe, which
is our first course, is in the ice-box. Our dessert today is just
cake with chocolate cream frosting, and coffee. It is such a
simple Sunday dinner, but that's the kind I believe in!"</p>

<h2>CHAPTER XXIV</h2>

<div class='chaptertitle'>BETTINA VISITS A TEA-ROOM</div>


<div class='cap'>"AREN'T you a bit timid about driving?" asked Bettina,
as she stepped into the car beside Mrs. Dixon.</div>

<p>"Not now. You see, I've been practicing every evening with
Frank, and he says that I am as good a driver as he is! Oh,
Bettina, we are having so much fun these days! The little
house is a great success, and I'm really learning to cook!
I've had some dreadful failures; but Frank doesn't seem to
mind. You see, I know he gets a good meal downtown at
noon, and so I don't worry about him."</p>

<p>"Look, Charlotte! What lovely goldenrod! We must stop
and get some! Don't you love it?"</p>

<p>"Indeed I do! I have a rough brown waste-paper basket
that it looks stunning in. I set the jar of goldenrod right
inside! Frank is very fond of it."</p>

<p>"Charlotte, you're just like a bride yourself&mdash;thinking about
Frank's likes and dislikes."</p>

<p>"Am I?" laughed Mrs. Dixon as her color rose. "Well,
lately Frank seems just like his old self! He appreciates
everything so, and is so nice at home! And it seems that he
can hardly get home quickly enough! We have enjoyed getting
things settled and planning our future. Next year we may
build a house of our own, but I don't care to have it too large
to manage easily."</p>

<p>"Are you going to stop here?" asked Bettina, as Mrs. Dixon
slowed down after a peaceful stretch of level road.</p>

<p>"Yes, I want to show you something."</p><p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_91" id="Page_91">[91]</a></span></p>

<p>A short path led to a small house close to the road, but
almost hidden in a tangle of flowers and wild grapevines.</p>

<p>"Isn't this a cunning little rustic place?" asked Charlotte.
"Two friends of mine started it. See" (pointing to the sign
over the door), "it's called 'The Friendly Inn.' Inside you'll
find that quotation about living in a house at the side of the
road and being a friend to every man. You know that one.
These girls live on that farm over there. When they came
home from college they wanted something to do&mdash;some way
to earn money&mdash;but they didn't care to leave home. This is
such a splendid road that the autos swarm past all summer
long. These girls opened this little tea room, and serve luncheons
and tea here all summer. Most of their supplies come
directly from the farm. It is just a pleasant drive from the
city, and many people like to come out here in the afternoon.
I'll introduce you to the girls."</p>

<h2>CHAPTER XXV</h2>

<div class='chaptertitle'>BETTINA ENTERTAINS ALICE AND MR. HARRISON</div>


<div class='cap'>"BY the way, Bettina," said Bob, over the phone, "I saw
Harrison and asked him out to dinner tonight. He
said he was to call on Alice later, so I suggest that you invite
her, too."</div>

<p>Bettina smiled to herself at Bob's casual tone. Ought she
to ask him not to invite company without consulting her?</p>

<p>"No!" she decided emphatically. "Company or no company,
our meals shall be simple, but good enough for anybody.
I'll not change my menu for Alice and Mr. Harrison. I'm
sure they'll like it just as it is."</p>

<p>"To tell the truth, Bettina," said Alice's vivacious voice
over the telephone, "I'd love to come, if it weren't for that&mdash;that
man!"</p>

<p>"But, Alice, you're going to see him later."</p>

<p>"I know; worse luck! He's the most insufferable person I
know! You see, last night we had a little argument, and he
was very rude."</p>

<p>"Maybe he's coming to apologize."</p>

<p>"Don't you imagine it! He couldn't. He dislikes society
girls above all other people."</p>

<p>"Oh, Alice!"</p>

<p>"Well, he does! He told me so evening before last, out at
the park."</p>

<p>"Seems to me you're seeing a good deal of him for a man
you feel that way about."</p>

<p>"Well, you started it. You told me that he was a woman-hater,
and I thought it would be fun to reform him. At first<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_94" id="Page_94">[94]</a></span>
he thought me fine and sensible, but lately I've been showing
him how frivolous I really am. I suppose I hoped that by
this time he'd approve of everything I said and did. But he
won't. He seems actually to be trying to reform me! And
I won't be reformed! I could never be anything but frivolous
Alice if I wanted to! I hate those big, slow, serious men,
without any fun in them!"</p>

<p>"Cheer up, my dear!" laughed Bettina. "Come tonight, anyhow.
I like the frivolous kind, whether he does or not."</p>

<p>That evening, much to Bettina's secret amusement, Mr. Harrison
and Alice met on the doorstep.</p>

<p>"Don't think we came together," explained Alice, flippantly.
"A dinner and an evening of me are about all Mr. Harrison
can endure!"</p>

<p>"I couldn't have spared the time, anyhow, Miss Alice. You
see, I'm a busy man, and the people who are doing worth-while
things in this world are obliged to overlook some of the
amenities."</p>

<p>It was on Bettina's tongue to inquire how a busy man found
time to make so many calls as he was making now. But she
refrained, knowing well that lively Alice could hold her own
with any man in the universe, even though she might not be
doing the things that Mr. Harrison considered worth while.</p>

<p>"A fine dinner," said he to Bettina, as they sat down at the
table. "I admire a woman who knows how to prepare and
serve food. She is paying her way in the most dignified and
worth-while profession of all&mdash;that of a home-maker."</p>

<p>"Mr. Harrison," asked Alice severely, "may I inquire
whether or not you know how to drive insects out of cabbage
before serving it?"</p>

<p>"I'm afraid I don't."</p>

<p>"Well, I'm surprised, for even I know that. Bettina just
told me. You place the cabbage, head downward, in cold
water, to each quart of which has been added a tablespoonful
of vinegar."</p>

<p>"Silly Alice!" said Bettina. "Don't tease! Look at my
lovely pansies. Alice, I believe you gave me that flower-holder
when I announced my engagement."</p><p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_95" id="Page_95">[95]</a></span></p>

<p>"When I announce my engagement&mdash;&mdash;" said Alice.</p>

<p>Bettina saw a strange and startled look come over Mr. Harrison's
face, which immediately departed when Alice added:</p>

<p>"Which will be years hence, no doubt&mdash;I hope my friends
will give me nothing useful. I love to come here, Bettina, but
I'm not a natural-born housekeeper like you. I shall marry
an idle millionaire, and we will do nothing but travel aimlessly
about from one end of the world to the other. That is my idea
of perfect happiness!"</p>

<p>That night for dinner Bettina served:</p>

<h2>CHAPTER XXVI</h2>

<div class='chaptertitle'>OVER THE TELEPHONE</div>


<div class='cap'>BOB and Bettina were at breakfast one morning when the
telephone rang. "It's Mrs. Dixon, Bettina," said Bob, his
hand over the mouthpiece. "Much excited. Panicky. House
afire. Hurry."</div>

<p>"Hello, Charlotte!" said Bettina, quickly. "What in the
world is the trouble?"</p>

<p>"The worst yet!" came a nervous voice. "Frank's Aunt
Isabel is to be at our house tonight! Oh, I wish you knew
her! She never did approve of me!"</p>

<p>"Oh, Charlotte, you just imagine that! She wouldn't come
if she disliked you so!"</p>

<p>"That's just it! She didn't approve of me when we lived
at the hotel, and now that we've taken a house, she wants to
see how things are."</p>

<p>"Well, things are fine! Doesn't Frank say so?"</p>

<p>"Yes, of course. But the meals! Two company meals to
get, and for a critical person like her, too! What on earth
shall I do?"</p>

<p>"Now, don't be nervous, Charlotte! It's easy! We'll think
up a delicious little dinner that you can prepare mostly beforehand.
When does she arrive?"</p>

<p>"Five o'clock, and leaves just after breakfast."</p>

<p>"Good! Two simple meals and all day in which to get them
ready. Let's see. The weather is warm, so you will prefer a
dinner that is partly cold. Watermelon that has been in
the refrigerator all day would be a simple dessert, with no
cake or anything else to think of. How about cold boiled<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_98" id="Page_98">[98]</a></span>
tongue for your main dish? Sliced thin and garnished with
parsley. You might also have a very good salad. Apple, celery
and green pepper salad would be delicious and economical
also. Then you might have corn on the cob. I've had it
recently and know how good it is. That would be the only
thing you would have to think of at meal time, and it is very
easy to cook. You would serve it in a napkin to keep it hot.
Then I want to send you some peach butter that I made the
other day; that would go beautifully with your dinner. There
you have it all! If I were doing it, I should add iced tea to
drink, served very daintily, with sliced lemon and mint leaves."</p>

<p>"Oh, Bettina, how good it sounds! Will you repeat that

A fresh beef tongue of two pounds<br />
1 <abbr title="tablespoon">T</abbr>-vinegar<br />
</div>

<p>Wipe the tongue well. Place in a kettle and cover with cold
water. Add the vinegar. Bring to a boil, and boil slowly
until it seems tender when pierced with a fork. (It should
boil at least two hours.) Take the tongue from the water,
and remove the skin and roots while it is still warm. Cool,
and slice thin. This may easily be cooked in the fireless cooker,
in which case the water with which the tongue is covered must
be brought to a good boil on the stove, and then removed to
the cooker. If the tongue is very salty, soak in cold water for
two hours.</p><p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_99" id="Page_99">[99]</a></span></p>

<p>Carefully remove husks and all silk from the corn. Cover

is old. If salt is added to water, it turns the corn yellow and
toughens the husks. Very tender young corn needs little cooking.
Salt may be added (one teaspoon to a quart of water)
two minutes before removing from the fire.</p>

<h2>CHAPTER XXVII</h2>

<div class='chaptertitle'>BETTINA HAS A BAKING-DAY</div>


<div class='cap'>"WHY, Ruth, I didn't hear you come in!"</div>

<p>"The door was partly open&mdash;Bob must have left it
that way&mdash;and I slipped in quickly to see what you were up
to. It's raining as if it never intended to stop. I called to Bob
on his way downtown, and asked what you were doing today.
He said that wonderful baking preparations were going on because
you expected his sister Polly and her three children tomorrow.
That sounded like a deluge&mdash;all those lively youngsters,
and Polly livelier yet&mdash;so, I came over to see if I couldn't
help."</p>

<p>"Indeed you can, Ruth! That was dear of you! We'll have
a houseful, won't we? I have planned to put Polly and
Dorothy and the baby in the guest room, but Donald will have
to sleep on the davenport. And I'm planning to do most of the
cooking today, so that tomorrow we can visit and see people
and show the children the sights. They are coming this afternoon,
and will be here Sunday and Monday at least. As soon
as I finish filling these salt-shakers, I'll begin the baking. Goodness,
it will certainly be a help to have you here, Ruth! You
were such a dear to come in all this rain!"</p>

<p>"Oh, I like it! I always learn so much from you, Bettina.
But what on earth are you doing with that rice?"</p>

<p>"Just putting a few grains in the shakers. You know salt
gets damp on a rainy day like this, and the rice loosens it and
absorbs the moisture. I'm doing it first because I might forget."</p>

<p>"What are you going to make?"</p>

<p>"Well, I'll cook some potatoes and beets to warm up or
make salad of, and I'll make a veal loaf and a white cake, I<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_101" id="Page_101">[101]</a></span>
think. Then some salad dressing, and a berry pie and some
sour cream cookies. Oh, yes, some nut-bread and some tomato
gelatin, too."</p>

<p>"Goodness! Can you use all those things?"</p>

<p>"Yes, indeed! For tonight's dinner I'll have lamb chops,
and some of the cooked potatoes, creamed, and tomato gelatin,
and the blackberry pie. (You know berry pies ought to be
eaten soon after they are made.) If tomorrow is a nice day,
we'll eat our dinner in the park, and in any case, I'll be prepared,
for I'll have the veal loaf, and the beets to warm up,
and the rest of the potatoes to cream or make salad of, and the
nut-bread for sandwiches if we need them, and the cake and
some sliced peaches for dessert."</p>

<p>"And the cookies?"</p>

<p>"Well, children always want cookies. I'll bake these on my
big baking sheets just the size of the oven, and I'll put lots
of raisins on top."</p>

<p>"Bettina, what fun it would be to visit you! But we must
get at our work or Polly and family will be here before this
big baking is done!"</p>

<h2>CHAPTER XXVIII</h2>

<div class='chaptertitle'>POLLY AND THE CHILDREN</div>


<div class='cap'>"WILL you look at the way that child eats her cereal!"
ejaculated Polly at the breakfast table. "And I
simply can't get her to eat it at home! In fact, on warm days
like this, she won't eat any breakfast at all."</div>

<p>"I like Aunt Betty's cereal; it looks so pretty," explained
little Dorothy gravely, looking down at her plate of moulded
cereal surrounded by plump red raspberries.</p>

<p>"I hope you don't mind my serving it cold today," said
Bettina. "It seemed so warm yesterday that I cooked the
cereal and put it in moulds in the refrigerator."</p>

<p>"No indeed! The change is a regular treat for the children.
They like fixed-up things like this, and it certainly does give
anyone an appetite."</p>

<p>"Well, in hot weather, no one feels much like eating, anyhow,
so I try to make things as attractive as I can. And I
want the children to have just what they like.... You
needn't be afraid of this cream, Polly. We buy it from a
neighbor, and I am absolutely sure that it is both clean and
good. I'm ashamed to say that we have no certified milk in
this town. Isn't that dreadful? And people keep on buying it
of dairies that they don't know one thing about! Why, I've
seen women who had just moved to town, and who knew nothing
about conditions here, begin housekeeping by cleaning house
thoroughly from top to bottom, and at the same time, leave
an order for milk with the first dairy wagon that happened to
drive down their street! And they buy groceries and meat
from the nearest stores without knowing that three blocks<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_104" id="Page_104">[104]</a></span>
away there may be other stores that are better, cleaner and less
expensive. Shouldn't you think that women would insist upon
knowing all about the food they are giving their children? It
seems to me that much common sense in a housewife is a great
deal more important even than knowing how to cook and sew."</p>

<p>"I think that knowing how to plan and buy is more important
than knowing how to do things with your hands," said
Polly. "After all, it's the result that counts. You're a wonder,
Bettina, because you have a useful head and useful hands,
too, but I haven't. So I try to know as much as possible about
every article of food and clothing that I buy, and to be sure
that I am getting the very best value from Tom's money, but I
don't know how to cook or sew or trim hats or embroider. I
like friends and babies and outdoor exercise, but I'll confess
that I don't like housework."</p>

<p>"Well, Tom and the children seem to be perfectly contented
and happy, and so do you. Therefore, you are a successful
housekeeper."</p>

<p>"You are the right kind of a sister-in-law to have, Betty! I
quite approve of Bob's choice!"</p>

the wheat. Allow to remain in mould for fifteen minutes.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_105" id="Page_105">[105]</a></span>
Remove from mould, surround with more berries and serve.
If desired cold, chill in the refrigerator. Cereals may be
cooked in a double boiler or a fireless cooker.</p>


<div class='recipetitle'><b>Method of Cooking Cereals</b></div>

<p>Put the water and salt in the upper part of double boiler
and place directly over the flame. When the water boils, add
the cereal very slowly, stirring constantly. Cook for five minutes
directly over the fire. Place the upper part in the lower
part of the double boiler containing boiling water, and cook
the required time. All cereals must be thoroughly cooked.</p>

</div>

<div class='unindent'><span class='letter'>"H</span>ONK! Honk!" sounded
an auto horn at Bettina's
door one cool morning, as
a crowd of lively voices also
summoned her.</div>

<p>"Bettina, O, Bettina! We've
come to get you to play tennis
with us this morning. You
must! You've been neglecting
us for Bob and we're jealous."</p>

<p>"Oh, girls, I simply can't! I
have just bought quarts and quarts of cherries and currants
of a boy who came to the door, and I must take today to put
them up!"</p>

<p>"That's easy! Leave 'em till tomorrow!" said Alice cheerfully.</p>

<p>"I can't do that, because they're just at the canning point
and it isn't a good thing to have them a bit over-ripe. Then
these are freshly picked, and that is the best way to have
them."</p>

<p>"I'll stay and help; may I?" said Ruth, who had suddenly
developed a deep interest in things domestic.</p>

<p>"Why, of course I'd love to have you, Ruth, but seeding
cherries is slow work, and I believe that playing tennis would
be more exciting."</p>

<p>"But not half so interesting as to hear you tell me how you
do things. I love to listen."</p><p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_108" id="Page_108">[108]</a></span></p>

<p>"We'll all stay," suggested Mary. "It'll do us good. But
you'll have to lend us big aprons; can you?" And she looked
down at her white middy, skirt, and shoes.</p>

<p>"Come on!" shouted Elsie. "You can lecture as we seed
cherries, Bettina. How are you going to put them up?"</p>

<p>"Well, Bob likes plain currant jelly, and plain canned cherries
awfully well. I may preserve some cherries with currant
juice, too, but I think I'll not do anything very elaborate
today."</p>

<p>"Goodness, that sounds elaborate enough to suit me! Will
you be looking over the currants while we are stoning cherries?"</p>

<p>"Leave the stones in half of them, girls; many people like
them that way better."</p>

<p>"What were you doing to all those jars?"</p>

<p>"Just getting ready to sterilize them. You see I'll put
them on a folded cloth, in this big kettle of cold water. Then
I'll slowly heat the water to the boiling point, and fill the jars
immediately with the fruit and syrup. I must scald the rubber
rings, too, before I use them."</p>

<p>Bettina was rapidly looking over currants as she talked.
"Girls, do you notice my jelly strainer? See, it's a piece of
cheese-cloth fastened into a wire strainer. It can be attached
to any kettle. I haven't used it yet, but I know that it will be
very convenient. You know it's best to strain the juice through
the cheese-cloth without pressure. If I have the cloth double,
the juice will be quite clear. If I wanted an especially clear
jelly, I could even have the juice pass through a flannel or
felt bag."</p>

<p>"How on earth can you tell when the jelly jells?" asked
Ruth.</p>

<p>"Well, I test it this way. I take up, in a cold silver spoon,
a little of the mixture that is cooking. If it jells and breaks
from the spoon, it has been cooking long enough. Of course I
remove the rest from the fire while testing it, because it might
be done."</p>

<p>"Bettina, cooking and jelly-making and things like that seem
to be so natural for you!" cried Ruth. "I get so frightened<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_109" id="Page_109">[109]</a></span>
sometimes when I think what if I should be a poor housekeeper
and make Fred unhappy!"</p>

<p>"Alice," said Mary, "Heaven forbid that either of us should
ever be talking like that about a man!"</p>

<p>"Goodness, I should say so!" declared Alice emphatically, a
little too emphatically, thought Bettina.</p>

<div class='level'>(All measurements are level)</div>


<div class='recipetitle'><b>Currant Jelly</b></div>

<div class='ingredients1'>
2 qts. currants<br />
sugar<br />
</div>

<p>Pick over currants, but do not remove the stems. Wash
and drain. Mash a few with a vegetable masher in the bottom
of a porcelain-lined or granite kettle. Add more currants and
mash. Continue adding currants until all are used. Bring
to a boil slowly and let simmer without stirring until the currants
appear white. Strain through a coarse strainer, and
allow juice to drain through a jelly bag. Measure the juice,
and boil ten minutes. Gradually add an equal amount of heated
sugar, stirring occasionally to prevent burning, and continue
boiling until the test shows that the mixture has jelled. When
filling sterilized glasses, place them in a pan containing a little
boiling water. This keeps the glasses from breaking when
hot jelly is poured in. Fill and set the glasses of jelly aside to
cool. Cover with hot melted paraffin.</p>


<div class='recipetitle'><b>Canned Cherries</b></div>

<div class='ingredients1'>
6 qts. cherries<br />
1½ qts. sugar<br />
½ pt. water<br />
</div>

<p>Measure the cherries after the stems have been removed.
Stone if desired. If they are stoned, be sure to save the juice.
Put the sugar and water in a kettle and stir over the fire until
the sugar is dissolved. Add the cherries and heat slowly to
the boiling point. Boil ten minutes skimming carefully. Put
into sterilized jars, filling the jars to overflowing with the
syrup. Seal securely. (When filling the jars stand them in
a pan containing boiling water. This keeps them from breaking.)</p><p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_110" id="Page_110">[110]</a></span></p>


<div class='recipetitle'><b>Bettina's Jelly-Making Suggestions</b></div>

<div class='hang1'>1. Use a porcelain-lined or a granite kettle.</div>

<div class='hang1'>2. Let juice drip from a cheese cloth or flannel bag.</div>

<div class='hang1'>3. Measure equal quantities juice and sugar.</div>

<div class='hang1'>4. Boil juice ten minutes, add heated sugar. (Heated by being
placed in warm oven.)</div>

<div class='hang1'>5. Boil until it drops thick from a cold silver spoon, or jells on a
plate.</div>

<div class='hang1'>6. The smaller the quantity of jelly made at a time, the clearer
it is.</div>

<div class='hang1'>7. Cook no more than three cups of juice at a time.</div>

<div class='hang1'>8. Skim carefully.</div>

<div class='hang1'>9. Boil regularly.</div>

<div class='hang1'>10. Pour in sterilized glasses.</div>

<div class='hang1'>11. Let stand in bright sun twenty-four hours.</div>

<div class='hang1'>12. Cover with very hot paraffin. This kills any bacteria that may
have collected.</div>

<div class='hang1'>13. Keep jelly in a cool, dark, dry place.</div>

<h2>CHAPTER XXX</h2>

<div class='chaptertitle'>A COOL SUMMER DAY</div>


<div class='cap'>"WHY, hello, Ruth!" cried Bettina at the door one afternoon.
"I haven't seen you for weeks, it seems to me!
What have you been doing? Come in and give an account of
yourself!"</div>

<p>"First let me deliver these nasturtiums that mother sent,"
said Ruth. "She always remembers how fond you are of
flowers."</p>

<p>"Thank you, they're lovely! I need them tonight for my
table, too. Will you come into the kitchen with me while I
put these in water?"</p>

<p>"M-m," said Ruth. "Something smells good! In the oven?"</p>

<p>"Yes, pork chops, baked apples and escalloped potatoes.
Peek in and see 'em."</p>

<p>"Outch!" cried Ruth, holding her hand in sudden pain. "I
forgot that that pan was hot, and started to pull it out to see
better! I'm a perfect idiot! I do that every time I have anything
in the oven!"</p>

<p>"That's a shame, Ruth, dear! Here, apply a little of this
olive oil! It's the nearest remedy I have. Vaseline is good,
too, or baking soda. Hold it with the damp cloth to keep out
the air."</p>

<p>"It feels better already," said Ruth. "I made some gingerbread
last evening for dinner&mdash;Fred was there&mdash;and burned
my hand in the same way exactly. And even at such a cost
the gingerbread wasn't very good. I think I didn't bake it quite
long enough. How long ought it to be in the oven?"</p>

<p>"Well, gingerbread takes longer than most quick-breads.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_112" id="Page_112">[112]</a></span>
Here, let me give you my time-guide for baking, and you can
keep it in your card-index. Then it's always at hand when
you want to refer to it."</p>

<p>"Thank you, that's a good idea, Bettina. May I sit down
here at the kitchen table and copy it?"</p>

<p>"Do, I'll get you a pencil and a piece of paper. Ruth, won't
you stay to dinner tonight?"</p>

<p>"I can't possibly, Bettina. I am going out with mother, and
should be at home now dressing. Oh, by the way, I had a
chance to refer last night to something you made me copy and
put with my recipe cards. 'How to Remove Grass Stains'! I
got it on my white dress&mdash;a dreadful looking stain&mdash;and immediately
referred to my card-index. It said, 'Moisten with
alcohol or camphor, allow to stand five minutes, and wash out
with clear water.' The stain came out like magic! I used camphor;
we didn't happen to have any alcohol in the house."</p>

<p>"I'm so glad it came out; that is such a pretty white dress.
And weren't you glad you knew just where to find a remedy?
It seems a little trouble to index things, but it is really worth
doing."</p>

<p>"I think so, too. Well, there's Bob, and I must rush off.
Bob, you're going to have a good dinner tonight! I've just
been investigating!"</p>

<h2>CHAPTER XXXI</h2>

<div class='chaptertitle'>BOB AND BETTINA ALONE</div>


<div class='cap'>"WHY, Bob, look at the front of your Palm Beach suit!"
exclaimed Bettina, after she had greeted Bob at the
door. "What in the world have you been doing?"</div>

<p>"Pretty bad; isn't it!" said he, ruefully. "Frank Dixon
brought me home in his car, and he had some sort of engine
trouble. We worked on it for awhile, but couldn't fix it, so he
phoned the garage and I came home on the street car. I must
have rubbed up against some grease. Do you suppose my
clothes are spoiled?"</p>

<p>"No-o," said Bettina, slowly, "not if I get at them. Let me
see; what is it that takes out auto grease? Oh, I know! Bob,
you go and change your clothes right away while I'm cooking
the meat for dinner. Then I'll doctor these."</p>

<p>"What will you do to them?"</p>

<p>"I'll rub them with lard, and let it stay on them for about
an hour. Then after dinner I'll wash them out in warm water
and soap, and then&mdash;well, Bob, I believe they'll be all as good
as new."</p>

<p>"I thank you, Mrs. Bettina."</p>

<p>When Bob returned and Bettina was putting the dinner on
the table, she smiled to herself over a new idea that had popped
into her head.</p>

<p>"Bob, what would you think if I should enter some of my
nut-bread at the state fair?"</p>

<p>"Well, is that what you've been smiling at all this time? I
think it would be fine. If I were judge you'd get first prize in<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_115" id="Page_115">[115]</a></span>

<h2>CHAPTER XXXII</h2>

<div class='chaptertitle'>BETTINA ATTENDS A MORNING WEDDING</div>


<div class='cap'>"HOW lovely!" Bettina whispered to Bob after the beautiful
ceremony had taken place in the rustic grape
arbor. "How like Cousin Kate this is! But I had no idea that
Frances planned to be married out of doors, had you?"</div>

<p>"She told me that they were hoping for fair weather, but
weren't counting on it."</p>

<p>"And this is a regular golden day; isn't it! What a time to
remember! Bob, look at Cousin Kate's flowers! A natural
altar, without decoration! Poppies, sweet-peas, nasturtiums,
cosmos, more kinds than I can count! It's a little earlier than
they usually have weddings, too; isn't nine-thirty early?"</p>

<p>"Yes, but Frances thought that this would be the prettiest
time for it, and you know they aren't at all conventional."</p>

<p>"What are you two gossiping about?" shouted big Cousin
Charles in Bettina's ear: "don't you see enough of each other
at home without avoiding the rest of us at a time like this?
Go and kiss the bride and congratulate the groom as soon as
you can get to them. Fanny wants to see you particularly, Bettina.
Breakfast is to be served on the porch; don't forget that
you two are to be at the bride's table!"</p>

<p>The wide porch looked very charming. Each table seated
four, except the one for the bridal party and near relatives,
which was in the center, surrounded by the others. On each
table was a basket of pink sweet-peas and trailing greenery.
Each simple white place-card held a flower or two, slipped
through two parallel cuts across the corner. Frances was
seated at the groom's left, and at her left sat her new brother-in-law,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_118" id="Page_118">[118]</a></span>
who was the best man. Next to him was the minister's
wife, then jolly Cousin Charles, the bride's father, then the
groom's mother. At the right of the groom sat Anne, Fanny's
sister, who was maid-of-honor; and next to her sat the clergyman.
Then came the bride's mother and the groom's father.
Beyond him sat Bettina, then Bettina's cousin Harry, then Aunt
Nell and Bob. That was all, for there were few near relatives
and Bettina's father and mother were in California.</p>

<p>"Frances looks well; doesn't she?" said Aunt Nell to Bettina.
"No showers, no parties or excitement, and you can see
how simple the wedding has been. Cousin Kate is so sensible,
and so is Frances. I can tell you already that the breakfast
menu will be dainty and delicious, but simple."</p>

large, round loaf cake pan, having a hole in the center. Bake
forty-five minutes in a moderate oven. When the cake is removed
from the oven, allow it to stand in a warm place for

<div class='recipetitle'><b>Suggestions for Serving the Bride's Cake</b></div>

<p>The Bride's Cake may be baked in this form and placed in
the center of the table for the central decoration. A tall, slender
vase, filled with the flowers used in decorating, may be
placed in the hole in the cake. Place the cake upon a pasteboard
box four inches high and one inch wider than the cake.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_120" id="Page_120">[120]</a></span>
This gives space to decorate around the cake. The cake and
box may be placed on a reflector, which gives a very pretty effect.
If cake boxes containing wedding cakes are distributed
among the guests as favors, use the one in the round pan for
central decoration and bake others in square pan. Square
pieces may then be cut, wrapped in waxed paper, and placed

<div class='chaptertitle'>AFTER THE "TEA"</div>


<div class='cap'>"DOESN'T it bore you to think of cooking when you've
been out all afternoon?" asked Mrs. Dixon, wearily.
"And today the refreshments were so elaborate and everything
was so stiff and tiresome!"</div>

<p>"I usually anticipate feeling this way," said Bettina, "and
plan to have something at home that is already prepared, and
that I can get together without much trouble. Then I put on
a house dress as quickly as I can, for I can't bear to cook in
party clothes. But I'm sure I don't know what I am going to
have for dinner tonight. Bob and I had planned to go downtown
to dinner with some friends, but just before I went out
this afternoon he phoned that the invitation had been withdrawn
because of somebody's illness."</p>

<p>"Goodness!" cried Mrs. Dixon, "what will you do? Go
downtown yourselves?"</p>

<p>"No; Bob doesn't enjoy that, and neither do I. I can manage
somehow, for of course there are always things in the
house to get. I'll tell you. I'll phone Bob to bring Mr. Dixon
here, and you can see what an emergency supper is like."</p>

<p>"Oh, I couldn't think of it! You're tired, and it's nearly
six now!"</p>

<p>"Well, what of that? You can help. And I know you're
dreading to get dinner at home. We'll just combine forces."</p>

<p>Bettina went to the telephone and called Bob. "Hello, dear!
Please bring Mr. Dixon home to dinner with you; Charlotte
is going to stay. And if you come in his car, will you stop on<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_122" id="Page_122">[122]</a></span>
the way and get a watermelon that has been on ice? Be sure
it's cold!"</p>

<p>"And now," she said to Mrs. Dixon, "let me get into a house-dress,
and then for a sight of the refrigerator."</p>

<p>"Oh, what beautiful glazed apples!" exclaimed Mrs. Dixon
ten minutes later.</p>

<p>"They were to have been for breakfast, but I'll have them
for dinner instead. Then there are enough cold boiled potatoes
for creamed potatoes; and, besides that, we'll have an omelet.
And then I'll stir up some emergency biscuit&mdash;&mdash;"</p>

<p>"And you can explain everything that you do!"</p>

<p>"Well, for the omelet&mdash;we'll take four good-sized eggs&mdash;one
for each of us&mdash;&mdash;"</p>

<p>"What else goes in? Milk?"</p>

<p>"No, I think that hot water makes a more tender omelet.
Then I'll use a few grains of baking powder to assist in holding
it up, though that isn't necessary. We'll beat the yolks and
whites separately till they're very light. Goodness! There
come the men!"</p>

<p>"Here's your watermelon, Bettina!" called Bob. "A big fellow!
Don't forget to save the rind for pickles, will you? Why,
hello, Mrs. Dixon! Frank's here!"</p>

<p>The menu that night consisted of:</p>

<div class='recipetitle'><b>Omelet</b> (Four portions)</div>

<div class='ingredients1'>

<p>Beat the yolks until thick and lemon colored. Add hot water
(one tablespoonful to an egg), salt and pepper. Beat the
whites till stiff and dry. Cut and fold into the first mixture.
Heat the omelet pan, add the butter, turn the pan so that the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_123" id="Page_123">[123]</a></span>
melted butter covers the sides and bottom of the pan. Turn
in the mixture, spread evenly, turn down the fire and allow
the omelet to cook slowly. Turn the pan so that the omelet
will brown evenly. When well puffed and delicately browned
underneath, place the pan on the center shelf in a moderate
oven to finish cooking the top of the omelet. Crease across
center with knife and fold over very carefully. Allow to remain
a moment in pan. Turn gently with a spatula onto a hot
platter. Garnish with parsley. An omelet is sufficiently cooked
when it is firm to the touch when pressed by the finger.</p>

<h2>CHAPTER XXXIV</h2>

<div class='chaptertitle'>BETTINA GIVES A PORCH BREAKFAST</div>


<div class='cap'>BETTINA had risen early that beautiful July morning, for
she had much to do. Bob had insisted upon helping her,
and at eight, Ruth was coming.</div>

<p>"Such a simple breakfast after all, Bob! Do you think she'll
like it?"</p>

<p>"Sure she will! If she doesn't I'll disown her! Say, Bettina,
I haven't had my breakfast yet, and ten o'clock sounds
far away. May I have just one doughnut with my coffee?"</p>

<p>"Why, Bobby, Bobby! Did I forget you? Your Aunt Elizabeth
and the whole suffrage cause is on my mind this morning,
but I didn't think even that could make me forget you.
Help yourself to anything you see that looks good!"</p>

<p>The Aunt Elizabeth on Bettina's mind was an aunt of Bob's
who was to be in town between nine and twelve, in conference
with some of the leading suffragists of the city. She wished
to see the bungalow, and at ten o'clock Bettina was giving a
breakfast for her and the women with whom she was to confer.
It was with fear and trepidation that Bettina had invited
them, although she declared to herself that she was sure, sure,
sure, of every dish on the menu!</p>

<p>As she arranged the great graceful yellow poppies in the
center of the porch table, set for six, she was feeling somewhat
nervous.</p>

<p>"Bob, you must go now, or you'll be too late for the train.
Take a taxi home, not a street car."</p>

<p>"Taxi! You don't know my Aunt Elizabeth. She'd say,
'Say, young man, if you aren't saving your money any better<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_125" id="Page_125">[125]</a></span>
than this, you ought to be.' And we'd probably end by walking."</p>

<p>"Hurry, dear."</p>

<p>The train proved to be late, and Ruth and Bettina were ready
to the last detail. While beautiful, distinguished-looking Aunt
Elizabeth was dressing, Bettina was meeting guests at the door.
Before she realized it, she had introduced everybody to the
guest of honor, and was ushering them out to her charming
porch table.</p>

<p>"Oh, Ruth," she said in the kitchen, "isn't my Aunt Elizabeth
lovely? I'll say 'mine' now, not Bob's. I was in such
a hurry that I forgot to be frightened."</p>

<p>The breakfast consisted of:</p>

<div class='menu'>
Moulded Cereal on Bananas&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;   Whipped Cream<br />

<h2>CHAPTER XXXV</h2>

<div class='chaptertitle'>A PIECE OF NEWS</div>


<div class='cap'>AS Bettina was putting the finishing touches on her porch
table, set for dinner, and humming a little song as she
tried the effect of some ragged robins in a mist of candy-tuft,
all in a brass bowl, she heard a murmur of voices at her front
door.</div>

<p>"I'll tell just Betty; no one else must know&mdash;yet. But what
if I haven't the courage to tell even her?"</p>

<p>"Perhaps she'll suspect anyhow!"</p>

<p>"Goodness, Harry! You make me afraid to go in! Is my
expression different?"</p>

<p>The answer was not audible to Bettina, though she was sure
that she heard whispers and a little suppressed laughter. Certainly
it had sounded like Alice's voice! What? Could Mr.
Harrison be with her? For a moment Bettina stood stock still,
feeling like an eavesdropper. Then she let out a gasp of amazement.
"Well!" was all she said, and sat down to think. When
the door-bell rang, she could not at first gain the composure
necessary to answer it.</p>

<p>"Why, how are you, Alice? I haven't seen you for ages!
And Mr. Harrison! Do come in; you must stay to dinner, for
you're just in time. Bob will be home any minute."</p>

<p>"Oh, we couldn't stay!" answered Alice. "Har&mdash;Mr. Harrison
and I were walking home from town, and when we came
to this house, we couldn't help stopping to say 'hello.'"</p>

<p>Bettina was conscious of a strained feeling in the air, which
made her want to giggle&mdash;or shake Alice. After all, she
couldn't help overhearing! And yet she might be mistaken!<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_128" id="Page_128">[128]</a></span>
She found herself saying&mdash;she scarcely knew what&mdash;to keep up
the conversation.</p>

<p>"Do stay! We have a funny little dinner tonight, but I
believe you'll like it. Bob had been rather over-worked at the
office lately&mdash;and I tried today to think of some of his favorite
dishes for dinner. I wanted to have a jolly little meal to take
his mind off his worries. And it would help a lot if he could
see you two people. Do stay! Do you care for blueberry
tarts, Mr. Harrison? Well, that's to be our dessert!"</p>

<p>"My, that sounds fine!" said Mr. Harrison. "Couldn't we
stay, after all?" he asked, turning to Alice.</p>

<p>"Well, if you really, truly want us," said Alice to Bettina.</p>

<p>"Why, of course I do! I'm delighted to see you! I think
we're fortunate. Mr. Harrison, you are usually so busy that
we scarcely dare invite you!"</p>

<p>"I suppose I ought to be at work today, but I'm taking a
little holiday. I couldn't put my mind on business."</p>

<p>He was actually blushing, Bettina thought. Suddenly she
found Alice's arms around her and Alice's laughing face hidden
on her shoulder. "Don't, Harry! Let me be the one to
tell her!"</p>

<p>And so Bob found them, all laughing and talking at once.</p>

<p>"Hurrah!" said he when he heard the news. "The best possible
idea! Is dinner ready, Bettina? Get out some grape
juice and we'll drink to the health and future happiness of
Alice and Harry! I'm the man that made this match!"</p>

<div class='chaptertitle'>BETTINA ENTERTAINS HER FATHER AND
MOTHER</div>


<div class='cap'>"WE had no such steak as this in California!" declared
Bettina's father with satisfaction, as Bob served him
a second helping.</div>

<p>"But then," said Bettina's mother, "did you find anything in
California that you thought equalled anything in your own
state? Father never does," said she, laughing. "He seems to
enjoy traveling because it makes him feel that his own home
is superior to every other place on earth. And it is," she
agreed, looking about her happily. "I can say that after a
summer spent in California, I'm more than thankful to be
back again."</p>

<p>"I was afraid that you and father would be so anxious to
open up the house that you wouldn't agree to come here for
your first meal."</p>

<p>"Of course we're anxious to get home," said Mother, "but
after you wrote Father that if he would come here to dinner
tonight you would have a steak cooked just to suit him, he was
as eager as a boy to get here."</p>

<p>"Well, who wouldn't look forward to it, after a summer spent
in hotels?" said Father. "And I must say that Bettina's dinner
justifies my eagerness. It's exactly right&mdash;steak and all."</p>

<p>Wipe the meat with a damp cloth. Have a tin pan sizzling
hot. Place the meat in the pan and cook directly under the
broiling flame. Turn frequently with spoons, as a fork will
pierce the meat and allow the juices to escape. A steak an
inch and a half thick should be cooked from eight to ten minutes.
Place the steak on a hot platter. Sprinkle with salt,
lemon juice and parsley. Dot with butter. Serve very hot.</p>

<h2>CHAPTER XXXVII</h2>

<div class='chaptertitle'>THE BIG SECRET</div>


<div class='cap'>"COME in, Alice! Now do say that you'll stay to dinner,
for we can talk afterward."</div>

<p>"Well, if you'll take me out into the kitchen where you are
working. You see, I have all this to learn, and I'm depending
on you to help me."</p>

<p>"Of course I'll help, Alice, but you are so clever about anything
that you care to do that I know you'll soon outstrip your
teacher. Tell me first, does anyone know the Big Secret yet?"</p>

<p>"Not a soul but Bettina, Bob, and my family. That is what
I came to talk about."</p>

<p>"Oh, Alice, I'd love to be the one to give the announcement
luncheon, or the breakfast, or whatever you prefer to have it!"</p>

<p>"Would you do it, really? Bettina, I've been longing to have
you offer, but it is work and trouble, and I didn't want to
suggest it."</p>

<p>"Why, Alice, I just enjoy that kind of work! I'd be flattered
to be allowed to have it here. Of course, you know that
I can't do anything very elaborate or expensive, but I'm sure
that between us we can think up just the prettiest, cleverest
way of telling it that any prospective bride ever had!"</p>

<p>"Bettina, my faith is in you!"</p>

<p>"When do you plan to be married?"</p>

<p>"Late in October or early in November, I think. And I'd
prefer not to have it announced for a month. You see, I don't
want to allow time for too many festivities in between."</p><p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_134" id="Page_134">[134]</a></span></p>

<p>"Oh, Alice, if you take my advice, you won't have any
showers or parties at all. I know you! If you do allow it,
you'll have more excitement than any bride in this town!"</p>

<p>"Well, Harry advises me not to, but oh, Betty, you know
how it is! I know so many people, and I do like fun, and
then Mother likes to think of me as the center of things. She's
afraid that when I am married to Harry I'll become as quiet
as he is, and then too, I honestly don't think she'd feel that I
was really married without it. You know sister Lillian had
lots of excitement and more parties crowded into a day
than&mdash;&mdash;"</p>

<p>"Yes, and she was so tired that she nearly fainted when she
stood up to be married!"</p>

<p>"That's true, but she liked the fun, anyhow. She says that
a girl can have that kind of fun only once, and she's silly to
deny herself. Well, I'll have a whole month to think it over
in. I've been sitting here all this time, Bettina, trying to decide
what it is that you are making&mdash;those croquettes, I mean."</p>

<p>"They are potato and green corn croquettes, and Bob is very
fond of them. I made them because I happened to have some
left-over corn. Until I learned this recipe, I didn't know what
to do with the ears of cooked green corn that were left."</p>

<p>"And what is the meat dish?"</p>

<p>"Well, that is made of left-overs, too, but I think you'll like
it. Creole Lamb, it is called. It is made of a little cold cooked
lamb that was left from last night's dinner. The rhubarb
sauce that I am serving with the dinner was our dessert last
night. But I do have a very good new dessert!"</p>

<p>"New or not, the dinner does sound good. There is Bob,
now, and I'm so glad, for I confess that my appetite is even
larger than usual!"</p>

<h2>CHAPTER XXXVIII</h2>

<div class='chaptertitle'>AFTER THE CIRCUS</div>


<div class='cap'>"THERE is nothing so exciting as a circus," said Ruth,
"but oh, how comfortable and peaceful it seems to
get away at last from the crowds and the noise! How quiet
and cool this porch is, Bettina. In two minutes I'll get up and
help you with dinner, but you made a mistake to put such a
comfortable chair here in this particular spot."</div>

<p>"Ruth, stay just where you are! This meal is supper, not
dinner, and it will be ready in the shortest possible time. Where
are the men?"</p>

<p>"Going over the plans of our house, I suppose. Fred has
worn them almost in pieces by exhibiting them so often. There
seem to be a great many details to settle at the last minute.
As for me, I'm perfectly satisfied, for I'm going to have a
kitchen exactly like yours. Bettina, what lovely nasturtiums,
and how delicious that cold sliced ham looks with more nasturtiums
to garnish it!"</p>

<p>"Yes, and I have nasturtium leaves lining the salad bowl&mdash;and
see, I'll put one large flower on each plate!"</p>

<p>"Don't nasturtiums always seem cool and appetizing? The
whole supper looks that way!"</p>

<p>"Well, circus day is almost invariably warm, and people are
tired when they come home, so I planned to have a cold and
simple meal."</p>

<p>"Isn't boiled ham hard to prepare?"</p>

<p>"No, indeed, nothing could be simpler. I bought a half of
a ham&mdash;I like a piece cut from the large end&mdash;and I soaked it
for an hour in cold water. Then I brought it to a boil in<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_137" id="Page_137">[137]</a></span>
fresh cold water and a little vinegar, and transferred it to the
fireless cooker for five hours. Then I baked it for an hour in
the cooker, having first trimmed it, and covered it with brown
sugar and almost as many cloves as I could stick into it. It is
very tender and good, I think&mdash;one of the best of my fireless
cooker recipes."</p>

<p>"I am planning to have a fireless cooker when I keep house."</p>

<p>"That is fine, Ruth! You have no idea how they save both
gas and worry. Some day I'll give you all of my best fireless
recipes; I use my cooker a great deal. For instance, this
brown bread was steamed in the cooker. A fireless is invaluable
for steaming. I usually plan to have Boston Brown Bread,
Tuna or Salmon Loaf and a pudding all steaming in the large
compartment at once. Then I've learned to bake beautiful
beans in the cooker! I wonder what our grandmothers think
of Boston Baked Beans and Boston Brown Bread all made in
the fireless! I'm sure I could prove to any of them that my
way is just as good, besides being much cooler and more economical!
Well, shall we call Fred and Bob?"</p>

<p>The circus day supper consisted of:</p>

<h2>CHAPTER XXXIX</h2>

<div class='chaptertitle'>MRS. DIXON ASKS QUESTIONS</div>


<div class='cap'>"I &nbsp; HAD resolved," said Mrs. Dixon, at Bettina's dinner-table,
"not to accept another invitation to come here
until you people had eaten again at our house. But your invitations
are just too alluring for me to resist, and your cooking
is so much better than mine, and I always learn so much that&mdash;well&mdash;here
we are! For instance, I feel that I am about to
learn something this very minute! (Now, Frank, please don't
scold me if I talk about the food!) Bettina, how did you ever
dare to cook cabbage? It looks delicious and I know it is, but
I tried cooking some the other day and the whole house has the
cabbage odor in no time. Yours hasn't. Now what magic
spell did you lay on this particular cabbage?"</div>

<p>"Let me answer that," said Bob. "I want to show off! Bettina
cooked that as she always cooks onions and turnips, in a
a large amount of water in an uncovered utensil. Isn't that
correct, Bettina? Send me to the head of the class!"</p>

<p>"Yes, you're right. I did boil the cabbage this morning,
and of course I have a well-ventilated kitchen, but I don't
believe the odor would be noticeable if I had cooked it just
before dinner."</p>

<p>"I never used to eat cabbage," said Bob, "but I like Bettina's
way of preparing it. She never lets it cook until it gets
a bit brown, and so it has a delicate flavor. Most people cook
cabbage too long."</p>

<p>"Another question, Teacher. How did you manage to bake<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_140" id="Page_140">[140]</a></span>
these potatoes so that they are so good and mealy? Mine
always burst from their skins."</p>

<p>"Well," said Bettina, "I ran the point of the knife around
the outside of the potato. This cutting of the skin allows it
to swell a little and prevents it from bursting. Then I baked
it in a moderate oven. Another thing. I've discovered that
it is better not to pierce a potato to find out if it is done. I
press it with my fingers, and if it seems soft on the inside, I
remove it from the oven and press the skin until it breaks,
allowing the steam to escape. If I don't do that, a mealy
potato becomes soggy from the quickly condensing steam."</p>

<p>"Oh, Bettina, I'm so glad to know that! I like baked potatoes
because I know they are so digestible, but I never can
make them like these. Now I won't monopolize the conversation
any longer. You men may discuss business, or the war,
or anything you choose."</p>

<h2>CHAPTER XL</h2>

<div class='chaptertitle'>A TELEGRAM FROM UNCLE ERIC</div>


<div class='cap'>"WHAT shall I do with this butter, Bettina?" inquired
Bob, who was helping to clear off the table after
dinner one evening. "Put it in the ice-box?"</div>

<p>"The butter from the table?" asked Bettina. "No, Bob, I
keep that left-over butter in a covered dish in the cupboard.
You see, there are so many times when I need butter for cake
making or cooking, and prefer not to have it very hard. Then
I use that cupboard butter. There's the doorbell, Bob. Now
who do you suppose that can be?"</p>

<p>"A telegram from Uncle Eric," said Bob, when he returned
from the door. "Well, isn't that the limit! He's coming tonight!"</p>

<p>"Tonight!" echoed Bettina.</p>

<p>"Yes, on business. You see, there are so many people in
town for the state fair and there are several that he must see.
He's a queer old fellow&mdash;Uncle Eric is&mdash;and he has some queer
notions. Doesn't like hotels, or anything but home cooking.
He doesn't want anything elaborate, but he's pretty fussy about
what he does want. I'm sorry for you, Bettina, but I guess
we'll have to make him welcome. He's been pretty good to
me, in his funny way, and so I suppose he feels he can descend
on us without warning."</p>

<p>"But, Bob&mdash;tonight! Why, I'm not ready! I haven't groceries
in the house, or anything! And I was planning to give
you a cooked cereal for breakfast tomorrow."</p>

<p>"It's too bad, Betty," said Bob sympathetically, "but it seems<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_144" id="Page_144">[144]</a></span>
as if we'll just have to manage some way. Uncle Eric has
been good to me, you see. He's an old fogy of a bachelor, but
he has a warm heart way down underneath his crusty exterior.
And&mdash;&mdash;"</p>

<p>"Don't you worry, Bob," said Bettina heartily. "We will
manage. As a rule, I think it's pretty poor taste for anyone
to come without warning or an invitation, but maybe Uncle
Eric is an exception to all the rules. Tell me about him; do
you have time? When does the train get in? Do you have
to meet it?"</p>

<p>"I guess I'd better hurry right off now."</p>

<p>"But, Bob, tell me! What must I have for breakfast?"</p>

<p>"Anything but a cereal, Betty! Uncle Eric draws the line
at cereals. He has an awful time with his cooks, too. They
never suit him."</p>

<p>"Goodness, Bob!" said Betty, in despair. "And I have almost
nothing in my cupboard. It's as bare as Mother Hubbard's!"</p>

<p>"Good-bye, dear! I'm off! I know you'll think of some
thing."</p>

<p>Bettina smiled hopelessly at the masculine viewpoint, and
as soon as Bob had gone she sat down to think, a dish towel
in one hand and a spoon in the other.</p>

<p>"Be a sport, Bettina," she murmured to herself. "If Uncle
Eric doesn't like his breakfasts, it's his own fault for coming.
Get a pencil and paper and plan several cereal-less breakfasts,
so that while he is here you will never be at a loss."</p>

<p>Thus fortified by her common sense and what is less common,
her sense of humor, Bettina soon evolved the following
breakfast menus for Uncle Eric:</p>

<h2>CHAPTER XLI</h2>

<div class='chaptertitle'>BETTINA ENTERTAINS STATE FAIR VISITORS</div>


<div class='cap'>THE next morning when Bob and Uncle Eric had partaken
of a cereal-less breakfast, and Uncle Eric had even complimented
the cook, Bettina called her mother on the telephone.</div>

<p>"I was about to call you, Bettina. Won't you go to the fair
with us this afternoon? You know Cousin Mabel and the
children are here from Ford Center, and Cousin Wilfred may
arrive some time this morning."</p>

<p>"You do have your hands full this week, don't you, Mother?
Uncle Eric is at home only for breakfast, and I called up to
ask if you would all come here to dinner tonight."</p>

<p>"Oh, Bettina! I'm afraid it will be too much work for you,
dear!"</p>

<p>"I'll plan a simple meal, Mother; one that I can get together
in a hurry. In fact I've already planned it."</p>

<p>"But, in that case, you couldn't go to the fair with us this
afternoon, could you? And it's said to be especially good today."</p>

<p>"Why, yes, I could go. I can get the most of my dinner
ready this morning. What time would you start?"</p>

<p>"At two, I think. Well, Bettina, we'll come, but you must
make the meal simple, for we won't be back till six."</p>

<p>"Don't worry, Mother."</p>

<p>Bettina hastened to make her preparations, and at half after
one her house was in order and she was ready to go. Besides,
she was comfortably conscious of a well-filled larder&mdash;cold
fried chicken ready and waiting, cold boiled potatoes to be<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_148" id="Page_148">[148]</a></span>
creamed, green corn to be boiled, peaches to be sliced, and
delicious chocolate cookies to delight the hearts of the children.</p>

<p>"It will take only a few moments," she thought as she arranged
the nasturtiums on her dining table, "to set the table,
cream the potatoes, boil the corn, slice the peaches and make
the tea. And I believe it's the sort of a dinner that will suit
them."</p>

<p>The dinner for state fair guests consisted of:</p>

upon her shoulder.</div>

<p>"Gracious, Uncle John!" she exclaimed. "How you frightened
me! But I'm so glad to see you! Where is Aunt Lucy?"</p>

<p>"Here, somewhere. You know she took a few prizes herself
and is probably hanging around to hear any stray compliments
for her butter or preserves."</p>

<p>"Aren't you ashamed, John!" said Aunt Lucy, herself appearing
like magic. "I was just looking for the queen bee
among the others in this glass case."</p>

<p>"And here she is!" said Uncle John, laying his hand on Bettina's
shoulder, and laughing delightedly at his own joke.
"You've been looking in the wrong place."</p>

<p>"For that, Uncle John, I'm going to beg you and Aunt Lucy
to come home with me to dinner. Won't you? When did you
come in?"</p>

<p>"This morning, and we're making a day of it. We'd like
to see the fireworks this evening, but perhaps we could go to
your house and get back again. For that matter, you and Bob
could go with us to see the fireworks. How about it?"</p>

<p>"Oh, that would be splendid! Bob couldn't come to the

<h2>CHAPTER XLIII</h2>

<div class='chaptertitle'>SUNDAY DINNER AT THE DIXON'S</div>


<div class='cap'>"YOU seem to have gained in weight, Frank," said Bob,
as he and Bettina sat down to Sunday dinner with the
Dixons.</div>

<p>"And what's more, I've gained in spirits! Say, there's nothing
like living in a real home! Why, people, just think of
having Charlotte say to me as she did yesterday, 'Frank, Bob
and Bettina are coming to dinner to-morrow, and I want you
to plan the menu!' And here it is! Excuse me for seeming
too proud of my own good judgment and my wife's skill in
cookery, but&mdash;&mdash;"</p>

<p>"Hush, Frank! Maybe Bob and Bettina won't like your
choice of dishes or your wife's cooking!"</p>

<p>"What!" said Bob. "I have yet to meet the person who
doesn't like fried chicken! And roasting ears and new potatoes!
Sa-ay!"</p>

<p>"It's a man-size dinner all right, isn't it?" said Mr. Dixon.
"You know ever since I was a boy my idea of Sunday dinner
(at least in the summer) has been fried chicken with gravy,
new potatoes, boiled corn on the cob, and ice cream with sliced
peaches! Because ice cream is coming, isn't it, Charlotte? At
least I ordered it, and this appears to be my lucky day!"</p>

<p>"Indeed, it is coming," said Mrs. Dixon. "You see, Bettina,
ever since I came to keep house (thanks to you) I've
longed for the time to come when I could let Frank plan a company
meal that I could carry out to the last detail. I have tried
all these things before, although not all at the same time. I
have always suspected that he would order fried chicken and<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_152" id="Page_152">[152]</a></span>
its accessories (a 'little boy dinner' I called this), so when I
told him that he might plan the meal, I knew that I could cook
it. You see, I have wanted to invite you and Bob&mdash;oh, I've
been thinking of it for a long time, but you can cook so well
that I thought perhaps you'd rather eat at home!"</p>

<p>"Charlotte, this is a perfect dinner&mdash;far better than I could
get, I know."</p>

<p>"This salad is an acquired taste with me," put in Mr. Dixon.
"In my boyhood, my ideal dinner did not include salad, but
Charlotte said there must be one, so this was my choice. I
mixed the oil-dressing myself," he added with pride.</p>

<p>"It was a simple dinner to get," said Mrs. Dixon. "But now,
Frank, we mustn't boast any more about our own dinner, must
we? Bob and Bettina will laugh at us. You see, we're regular
children since we took the house, but we do have lots of
fun. I wouldn't go back to hotel living for anything in the
world!"</p>

<p>"And neither would I," said Frank, "if for no other reason
than the joy of entertaining our friends at dinner this way!"</p>

<div class='chaptertitle'>A RAINY EVENING AT HOME</div>


<div class='cap'>"THIS is just the kind of a cold, rainy evening," said
Bob as he pushed back his chair, "that makes me feel
like making candy."</div>

<p>"Fine!" said Bettina. "What kind shall it be?"</p>

<p>"Penoche, if you have all the ingredients."</p>

<p>"I think I have. Let's see. It's better when it's made partly
with 'C' sugar, and I have that. I wonder if there will be
enough milk left for breakfast if we use a little! Well, penoche
really tastes exactly as good when it is made with water instead,
though, of course, it isn't so rich. But then, I think, we
do have enough milk."</p>

<p>"First of all, though," said Bob, "we'll wash these dishes.
It was a mighty good dinner tonight, Bettina. The nice kind of
a hot meal that it seems good to come home to on a night like
this."</p>

<p>"It was an oven dinner, Bob. You see, the meat loaf, the
escalloped potatoes, and the rice pudding were all in the oven
at once. I always try to use the oven for more than one dish
if I am using it at all."</p>

<p>"We seem to have eaten all of this tomato sauce," said Bob,
as he carried out the dish, "but there is a good deal of meat
left. Will you have to make more sauce?"</p>

<p>"No, I planned just enough for one meal. Then, tomorrow,
I'll serve the rest of the meat cold without a sauce. How did
you like the rice pudding hot as it was tonight? You know
I usually serve it cold."</p>

<p>"It tasted very good for a cold evening. There, all these<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_155" id="Page_155">[155]</a></span>

<h2>CHAPTER XLV</h2>

<div class='chaptertitle'>RUTH MAKES AN APPLE PIE</div>


<div class="image-left">
<img src="images/oi_161.jpg" width="270" height="268" alt="Woman rolling out a pie crust in front of an open window" />
</div>

<div class='unindent'><span class='letter'>"I</span>'LL tell you, Ruth," said
Bettina, in answer to some
questions, "you come home with
me now, and make an apple pie
for our dinner! I'll watch and
direct you, and perhaps I can
show you what made the crust
tough on the one you made at
home. Do come. I can't promise
you an elaborate dinner tonight,
for my funds are very
low and I must be careful. But I had planned to make an
apple pie myself. Bob is so fond of it that no matter what else
we may have, an apple pie dinner is a feast to him."</div>

<p>"But goodness, Bettina! I might spoil it!"</p>

<p>"No, you wouldn't, and I would show you just what to do.
I suspect that you handled the dough too much before and
that was what made the pie seem tough."</p>

<p>"I suppose I did; I was so anxious to have it well mixed."</p>

<p>"Did you use your fingers in mixing in the shortening? I
know that many good cooks do it, but it is really better to use
a knife, with the blade flat. And then roll the pastry out just
as lightly as possible."</p>

<p>"Do you make pastry with lard or butter?"</p>

<p>"I usually make it with an equal amount of each. Lard
makes a more tender crust than butter, and a whiter crust,
but I think butter gives it a better flavor."</p><p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_160" id="Page_160">[160]</a></span></p>

<p>Bettina and Ruth had reached home by this time, and Bettina
brought out the materials for Ruth's pie. "I'll give you
ice-water to moisten the pastry," said she; "it isn't necessary,
but it is really better in the summer time. And while you're
mixing in the shortening with this knife, I'll be cooking some
eggs hard for eggs a la goldenrod which I am going to give
you tonight."</p>

<p>"Eggs a la goldenrod!" exclaimed Ruth, "How good that
does sound!"</p>

<p>"It is a very good luncheon-dish, but I find it also good
for dinner when I'm not having meat. I think it looks appetizing,
too."</p>

<p>"I must learn how to make it. You know Father comes home
at noon, and it is hard to think of a variety of luncheon-dishes.
I usually have eggs or cheese in some form or other, but 'eggs
a la goldenrod,' are new to me."</p>

<p>"We also have cottage-cheese tonight," said Bettina. "I
plan to make it about once a week. Ruth, I believe I hear Bob
now! Well, he'll have to wait half an hour or more for his
dinner!"</p>

<p>That night they had:</p>

one tablespoon butter and one tablespoon lard to get very hot
in a frying-pan. Put in the cakes, brown on each side, and
serve.</p>


<div class='recipetitle'><b>Cottage Cheese</b> (Four portions)</div>

<div class='recipetitle'><b>Some of Bettina's Pastry Rules</b></div>

<p>One&mdash;All the materials must be cold.</p>

<p>Two&mdash;Always roll one way and on one side of the pastry.</p>

<p>Three&mdash;Shortening should be handled as little as possible.</p>

<p>Four&mdash;Dough should be mixed with a knife and not touched
with the hands.</p>

<p>Five&mdash;Shortening should be cut in with a knife.</p>

<p>Six&mdash;Cook pastry in a hot oven having the greatest heat
at the bottom so that it may rise before browning. Crust is
done when it slips from the pan.</p><hr class="chap" /><p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_162" id="Page_162">[162]</a></span></p>




<h2>CHAPTER XLVI</h2>

<div class='chaptertitle'>BETTINA MAKES APPLE JELLY</div>


<div class='cap'>"WHAT have you been doing?" asked Bob, as he and
Bettina sat down to dinner.</div>

<p>"Oh, Bob, I've had the nicest day! Mother 'phoned me this
morning that Uncle John had brought her several big baskets
of apples from the farm, and that if I cared to come over to
help, we would put them up together, and I might have half.
Well, we made apple jelly, plum and apple jelly, and raspberry
and apple jelly. I had made all these before, and knew how
good they were, but I learned something new from Mother
that has made me feel happy ever since."</p>

<p>"And so you came home, and in your enthusiasm made this
fine dandy peach cobbler for dinner!"</p>

<p>"Bob, that was the very way I took to express my joy!"</p>

<p>"Well, what is this wonderful new apple concoction?"</p>

<p>"Perhaps it isn't new, but it was new to me! It is an apple
and mint jelly, and I know it will be just the thing to serve
with meat this winter."</p>

<p>"How did you make it? (I hope you are noticing how interested
I'm becoming in all the cooking processes!)"</p>

<p>"Well, I washed and cut into small pieces four pounds of
greening apples. Then I washed and chopped fine one cup
of fresh mint, and added it to the apples. I covered the mixture
with water, and cooked it all till the apples were so tender
that they were falling to pieces. I strained it then, and used
three-fourths of a cup of sugar for each cup of juice. I cooked
this till the mixture jellied, and then I added four teaspoons of<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_163" id="Page_163">[163]</a></span>
lemon juice and enough green vegetable color paste to give it a
delicate color."</p>

<p>"Isn't that coloring matter injurious?"</p>

<p>"Oh, no, Bob! It's exactly as pure as any vegetable, and it
gives things such a pretty color. Why, I use it very often, and
I'm sure that more people would try it if they knew how successful
it is! It is such fun to experiment with. Of course, I
never use anything but the vegetable coloring."</p>

<p>"Well, go on with the jelly. What next?"</p>

<p>"That's all, I think. I just poured it into glasses, and there
it is, waiting for you to help me carry it home from Mother's.
Now, Bob, won't that be good next winter with cold roast beef
or cold roast veal? I know it will be just the thing to use with
a pork roast!"</p>

<p>"I'm growing very enthusiastic. Sounds fine. But speaking
of cooking, this is a mighty good dinner. I like peach cobbler
as well as any dessert there is."</p>

<p>"I'm glad you like it. But I forgot to tell you, Bob, that I'm
to have all the apples I can use in the fall. Uncle John has
promised them to me. Then Mother says we'll make cider.
Won't that be fine?"</p>

<p>"I should say it will! Cider and doughnuts and pumpkin
pie! Makes me long for fall already! But then, I like green
corn and watermelon and peaches, so I suppose I can wait."</p>

<p>Peel cold boiled potatoes. Put two tablespoons of lard in
the frying-pan. When hot, add the potatoes and season well
with salt and pepper. Brown thoroughly on all sides. (They
should cook about ten minutes.)</p>


<div class='recipetitle'><b>Creamed Corn</b> (Two portions)</div>

<p>Mix sugar, salt and scalded milk. When lukewarm, add the
yeast cake dissolved in one-fourth of a cup of lukewarm water.
Add one and a half cups flour. Cover and set in a warm place
to rise. When double in bulk, add the butter (melted), four
tablespoons sugar and more flour (enough to knead). Let
rise, knead and roll into a sheet half an inch thick, spread
with a mixture made by adding melted butter, one and a
fourth cups sugar and the cinnamon. Roll up like a jelly
roll. Cut in slices three-fourths inch thick. Place in a pan one
inch apart, let rise again. Bake in a moderately hot oven
twenty-five minutes.</p>

<p>Cut the butter into the dry ingredients (baking powder, salt
and flour), and add the milk. (The resulting dough should be
of biscuit dough consistency.) Peel and slice the peaches, mix
well with the sugar (one-third cup) and place on the bottom of
a baking dish (not tin.) Place dough shaped to fit on the
top of the peaches. Make three holes to allow the steam to
escape. Bake thirty minutes in a moderate oven. Boil the
sugar and water four minutes. When the cobbler has cooked
for twenty minutes, pour the syrup over it and allow to cook
ten minutes more. Cream may be served with the cobbler if
desired.</p><hr class="chap" /><p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_166" id="Page_166">[166]</a></span></p>




<h2>CHAPTER XLVII</h2>

<div class='chaptertitle'>AFTER A PARK PARTY</div>


<div class='cap'>"A BEAUTIFUL day," said Bettina at the breakfast table.
"September is doing better than August."</div>

<p>"I was just thinking," said Bob, "that it might be fun to get
Harry and Alice, and go out to Killkare park this evening. I
don't believe you've been on a roller coaster this year."</p>

<p>"It would be fun to go," said Bettina, "although I haven't
missed the roller coaster."</p>

<p>"Well, let's ask them to go. We can stay there awhile and
then&mdash;&mdash;"</p>

<p>"Then what?"</p>

<p>"Oh, nothing. Then go home."</p>

<p>"Bob, you meant&mdash;come here afterward and have a nice little
lunch; didn't you?"</p>

<p>"I confess that I thought of that, and then I happened to
remember that you were going out this afternoon and wouldn't
want to bother with any preparations for a party."</p>

<p>"Going out this afternoon would not worry me at all&mdash;it is
just that my funds are getting a little low, and I couldn't serve
anything expensive. Let me think what I have on hand&mdash;yes,
I believe I could do it by serving a salad and a dessert out of
my own head."</p>

<p>"A Bettina salad? That's the very best kind. And what
will the dessert be?"</p>

<p>"A Bettina dessert, too. I have some lovely apples, Bob, and
I just can't afford anything very expensive. I know this will<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_167" id="Page_167">[167]</a></span>
be good, too, but you mustn't complain if I have sponge cake
to eat with it."</p>

<p>"I should say not, Bettina. Whatever you give us will tickle
me, and Alice and Harry are in such a state of blindness that
they won't know what they're eating."</p>

<div class='chaptertitle'>BETTINA SPILLS THE INK</div>


<div class='cap'>"WHERE are you, Bettina?" called Bob one September
evening when Bettina failed to meet him at the door.
"Oh, Bettina!"</div>

<p>"Here I am, Bob, in the kitchen! I'm so ashamed of myself!"</p>

<p>"What for?"</p>

<p>"My carelessness. I just spilled a whole bottle of ink on
this new apron of mine! I had begun to get dinner, and as it
was a little early, I sat down for a minute to finish a letter to
Polly. Then all at once I thought something was burning, and
jumped up in such a hurry that I spilled the ink. I ought to
have known better than to try to do two things at once! Luckily,
the dinner was all right, but look at this apron! And it
was such a pretty one!"</p>

<p>"Well, Bettina, I'm always getting ink and auto grease on my
clothes, and you seem to keep yours spotless. So it is a surprise
to me that it happened. Still, spoiling a new apron may
be unfortunate, but I shouldn't call it tragic. Is it really
spoiled?"</p>

<p>"No, I think I can fix it up so it will be almost as good as
new, but it's a nuisance. See, I'm soaking it in this sour milk.
I'll leave it here for four hours, and then apply some more
milk for awhile. Then I believe the ink will come out when I
rinse it."</p>

<p>"Well, Bettina, I'm glad you didn't spill ink on the dinner.

<div class='chaptertitle'>BETTINA ATTENDS A PORCH PARTY</div>


<div class='cap'>"WELL, what have you been doing today?" asked Bob,
after he had finished an account of events at the
office.</div>

<p>"I've been away all afternoon, Bob, at the loveliest little
porch party at Alice's! You know her porch is beautiful, anyhow,
and her party was very informal. She telephoned to
five of us this morning, and asked us to come over and bring
our sewing; the day was so perfect. She served a delicious
little luncheon from her tea cart, very simple but so good! And
the beauty of it was that she had made everything herself!
She didn't tell the girls, but she whispered it to me. Of course,
if she had told the others, she would have given herself away;
they are a little suspicious of her now because she is seen everywhere
with Harry!"</p>

<p>"He told me he wished they could announce it right away!
He doesn't like to make a secret of it."</p>

<p>"It won't be very long now&mdash;you know they are to be married
in October or November. But, Bob, as I was telling you,
Alice did all the cooking for this party herself. Of course, it
was simple, but really, I think she is quite wonderful. She has
never done anything useful before, but she is so clever, and
she has such a 'knack' that it will really be easier for her than
for Ruth. And Ruth will work twice as hard. Alice says that
she is going to give other little parties this way, and practice
on her guests. She says she is determined to do things just
as well as anybody else, and now that she is interested, she
has a tremendous pride in being a success. You know how<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_172" id="Page_172">[172]</a></span>
high-spirited Alice is. Well, she isn't to be surpassed by anyone
in anything she cares to do! Oh, I forgot, Bob, she gave
me some cakes to bring to you, and also some salted nuts."</p>

<p>"Hurray for Alice! She's some friend all right! What
else did you have at the party?"</p>

<h2>CHAPTER L</h2>

<div class='chaptertitle'>A DINNER COOKED IN THE MORNING</div>


<div class='cap'>"WE'LL treat Uncle Eric so well that he'll have a good
time in spite of himself," Bob had said when he had
proposed that his gruff old uncle be invited. "I'll take Saturday
afternoon off, and we'll go to the matinee, then we'll come
home to dinner, and then go again to the theatre in the evening."
For a great actor was to be in town, and this was the
reason for Uncle Eric's possible visit. "If he'll only come,"
Bob had added doubtfully.</div>

<p>"He'll come," said Bettina confidently, for she felt that she
had discovered the soft spot in Uncle Eric's heart. "We'll
have a good dinner, too."</p>

<p>Bob remembered what she had said about the dinner and
repeated it to himself as they stepped from the street car after
the matinee. "It's late, Bettina," he said anxiously, "will it
take you long to get dinner?"</p>

<p>"A very few minutes," answered Bettina. "Just long enough
to warm it over."</p>

<p>To warm it over! But then, all of Bettina's dinners were
good, so he resolved not to worry. Nevertheless, he could not
help leaving Uncle Eric for a few minutes to come into the
kitchen. "What can I do to help?"</p>

<p>"Not a thing, Bob dear. You see, I had this whole dinner
ready this morning, and I have warmed it all up in the oven.
I have discovered that croquettes are exactly as good when
fried in the morning, and so are veal cutlets. And wait till
you try the cauliflower!"</p><p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_174" id="Page_174">[174]</a></span></p>

<p>Wipe the meat, place in one and one-half pints of boiling
water, to which has been added one level teaspoon of salt.
Boil gently until tender (about thirty minutes). Remove from
the water and allow to cool until easy to handle. Remove the
bone and skin, and cut into pieces for serving. Mix the
paprika, salt (one-third of a teaspoon) and the cracker crumbs.
Roll each piece of meat in the crumbs, then in the egg, to
which the water has been added, and again in the crumbs.
Pat the crumbs onto the meat. Arrange the meat on a platter
and allow to stand fifteen minutes. Have sufficient fat in a
pan to cover articles of food. When the fat is smoking hot,
add the veal cutlets, and turn to cook each side. When a
delicate brown (after about five minutes), remove and drain
on paper. Keep hot in the oven. Place the veal cutlets on a
platter and arrange baked apples around the edges. Serve the
potato croquettes on the same platter, garnished with parsley.</p>

<h2>CHAPTER LI</h2>

<div class='chaptertitle'>A SUNDAY DINNER</div>


<div class='cap'>"WE have gone 'over home' for so many Sunday dinners
lately," Bettina had said to her mother, "that I want
you and father to come here tomorrow."</div>

<p>"But, Bettina," her mother protested, "isn't it too much
work for you? And won't you be going to church?"</p>

<p>"I can't go to church tomorrow, anyhow, for Bob's Uncle
Eric is to be in town all morning; he leaves at noon, and the
Dixons have offered us their car to take him for a drive.
Don't worry, Mother, I'll have a simple dinner&mdash;a 'roast beef
dinner,' I believe. I often think that is the very easiest kind."</p>

<p>Sunday morning was so beautiful that Bettina could not bear
to stay indoors. Accordingly, she set the breakfast table on
the porch, even though Uncle Eric protested that it was too
far for her to walk back and forth with the golden brown
waffles she baked for his especial delight. When he and Bob
had eaten two "batches," Uncle Eric insisted that he could
bake them himself for a while. He installed Bettina in her
chair at the table, and forced waffles upon her till she begged
for mercy.</p>

<p>"Gracious!" Bettina exclaimed as she heard the "honk" of
the Dixons' automobile at the door. "There are the Dixons
already and we have just finished breakfast! Bob, you and
Uncle Eric will have to go on without me, for I must get the
roast in the oven and do the morning's work."</p>

<p>"Well, I learned today to make waffles," said Uncle Eric.</p>

<div class='chaptertitle'>BOB MAKES PEANUT FUDGE</div>


<div class='cap'>"I USUALLY complain when it rains&mdash;I have that habit&mdash;but
I must confess that I like a rainy evening at home
once in a while," said Bob, as he and Bettina sat down at the
dinner table. "Dinner on a rainy night always seems so cozy."</div>

<p>"Liver and bacon don't constitute a very elaborate dinner,"
said Bettina. "But they taste good for a change. And oh,
Bob, tonight I want you to try a new recipe I heard of&mdash;peanut
fudge. It sounds delicious."</p>

<p>"I'm there," said Bob. "I was just thinking it would be a
good candy evening. Then, when the candy is done, we'll
assemble under the new reading lamp and eat it."</p>

<p>"Yes, it'll be a good way to initiate the reading lamp! Wasn't
it dear of Uncle Eric to give it to us? I kept wondering why
he was so anxious to know just what I planned to do with
the money I won for my nut bread at the fair. I even took
him around and pointed out this particular lamp as the thing
I had been saving for. And here it arrived the day after he
left, as a gift to me! It was dear of Uncle Eric! But now
what on earth shall I do with my fair money?"</p>

<p>"Don't worry about that, Bettina. Put it in the bank."</p>

<p>"But I'd like to get something as sort of a monument to my
luck. Have you any particular needs, Bob?"</p>

fine fruit gems over there."</p>

<p>Cover slices of calves' liver cut one-half inch thick with
boiling water. Allow to stand five minutes. Drain and cut
into pieces for serving. Sprinkle with salt and pepper and roll
in flour. Have a frying pan very hot. Add sliced bacon.
When the bacon has cooked on each side, pile up on one side of
the pan and add the liver, placing a piece of bacon on top of
each portion of liver, thus preventing the bacon from getting
too well done, and also seasoning the liver. Brown the liver

<div class='chaptertitle'>DINNER AT THE DIXONS</div>


<div class='cap'>"IS it still as much fun to keep house as it was at first,
Charlotte?" asked Bettina as she and Bob sat down to
dinner with the Dixons.</div>

<p>"Fun?" said Charlotte. "Bettina, look at me! Or better
still, look at Frank! And the funny part of it all is that Aunt
Isabel thinks our keeping house is a result of her preachments
against boarding and hotel living. Why, she quite approves
of me now! And I'll just keep quiet and let her feel
that she was the one who did it, but all the while in my heart
I'll be remembering that it was the sight of your happiness
that roused my ambition to make a home myself."</p>

<p>"I tell you," said Mr. Dixon, "we can never thank you
enough, Bettina. Now shall I play 'Home Sweet Home' on the
piano? And will you all join in the chorus?"</p>

<p>"Not if you sing, too," said Mrs. Dixon, smiling at her
husband's foolishness. "I've learned a great deal from you,
since I began, Bettina, and not the smallest lesson is that of
having company without dreading it. I don't try to make
things elaborate, just dainty and simple food such as we have
every day. Why, tonight I didn't make a single change for
you and Bob! And I don't believe I should dread even Aunt
Isabel's sudden arrival now."</p>

<p>"Aunt Isabel is really a good soul, Bettina," said Frank.
"Charlotte has never learned how much worse her bark is than
her bite, and she takes it to heart when Aunt Isabel speaks
her mind. Why, I remember so well the scoldings she used<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_183" id="Page_183">[183]</a></span>
to give me when I was a boy, and the cookies she would manage
to treat me with afterward! I used to anticipate those
pleasant scoldings!"</p>

must have given you an extra good one before inviting
us to partake of that delicious-looking chocolate pie!"</p>

of a long porch table. Ruth was giving a farewell luncheon
for Bernadette, her young cousin, who was leaving that night
for a fashionable New York school. Although there was no
suggestion of it in the dainty dishes the two girls served to the
hungry and vivacious young guests, Ruth was "trying out"
her cooking with all of the stage-fright of the beginner. The
recipes and suggestions were chiefly Bettina's, and the two
had been busy in Ruth's kitchen since early that morning.
Bernadette was a critical young person, although light-hearted
and affectionate, and Ruth felt that she could set her humble
efforts before no sterner judge. Yet all the while, as she
tasted each course in its turn, her mind was running on, "Will
Fred like this? Some day I'll be serving this to Fred!" It
was certainly a satisfaction to feel one's self able to cook a
luncheon acceptable to "the younger society set!"</div>

<p>With each course an enormous motto, supposedly of the
"Don'ts for School Girls' Series," was brought in ceremoniously
on a tray and suspended from the chandelier over the
table, until finally five huge, if foolish, "Don'ts" were dangling
there for Bernadette's inspection.</p>

<p>With the last course, Ruth, in the postman's hat, coat and
bag, brought in an endless supply of letters for Bernadette,
to be opened at such times as "When You Meet Your Impossible
Room-mate," "When You Feel the First Pangs of Homesickness,"<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_186" id="Page_186">[186]</a></span>
"When Reprimanded by a Horrid Old Teacher",
"When Forced to Mend Your Own Stockings,"  <abbr title="et cetera"> <abbr title="et cetera">etc.</abbr></abbr>-</p>

<p>Bernadette seized them all delightedly, glanced at the covers
and cried out, half in laughter, half in tears, "Oh, girls, I
simply can't go 'way off there! I'll die!" Her friends fell
upon her with scoldings and hugs, and in the midst of the
noise and clamor, Ruth and Bettina slipped out to laugh and
talk over Ruth's first serious culinary effort.</p>

<h2>CHAPTER LV</h2>

<div class='chaptertitle'>BETTINA PLANS AN ANNOUNCEMENT
LUNCHEON</div>


<div class='cap'>"AND so I thought, if you were willing, I would have the
luncheon the last of this week," said Bettina to Alice
one sultry afternoon which they were spending on Bettina's
porch.</div>

<p>"That's dear of you, Bettina. Oh, how queer it will seem
to have everyone know about it! You must let me help with
the luncheon, of course."</p>

<p>"No, indeed, Alice! Ruth and I are going to do it all alone,
and the guest of honor is not to lift a finger! You can advise
us, of course, but you mustn't arrive that day till everything
is ready. I want to tell you about a few plans I've made.
I wish I could consult Harry, too."</p>

<p>"But he won't be at the announcement party!"</p>

<p>"No, but he's the leading man in the drama, and important
even when off the stage. Let's telephone him to come here
to dinner tonight. It is so warm that I have planned only a
lunch, but we can set the porch table and have a jolly informal
time. Do call him up, Alice."</p>

<p>"I'd love to, of course, if you really want us."</p>

<p>"Indeed I do, but we'll have to hurry, for it's after five
now."</p>

<p>"I'll help you," said Alice, after Harry had given his hearty
acceptance. "Let me fix the salad."</p>

<p>"All right, and I'll stir up some little tea cakes. It's better
not to cut those beets too small, Alice; it makes them soft.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_189" id="Page_189">[189]</a></span>
I never add them till just before I serve the salad. There,
that's fine! Do you want to fix the parsley to garnish the
ham? Ham looks so much better with parsley that I never
fail to garnish it. I have nasturtiums for the center of the
table, and we'll garnish the salad with them, too."</p>

<p>"It will be a festive little meal. What else can I do while
you're baking the tea cakes?"</p>

<p>"You can make the iced tea, Alice. You do everything so
easily and deftly that I love to watch you. And you have
never cooked at all until lately, have you?"</p>

<p>"No, but I really like it. Wouldn't it be a joke if I should
become very domestic?"</p>

<p>"Well, your fate is pointing in that direction! Time is
swiftly passing, and in a few short weeks&mdash;Alice, shall I call
off the announcement luncheon?"</p>

<p>"Oh, no, no, Bettina! Let fate do her worst! I'm resigned."</p>

<div class='chaptertitle'>RUTH AND BETTINA MAKE PREPARATIONS</div>


<div class='cap'>"OH, Bettina, aren't the butterflies darling?" exclaimed
Ruth, looking once more at the table display of her
work. "And with everything ready to begin in the morning,
won't things be easy for us both? What shall I do next?"</div>

<p>"Not a thing, Ruth dear. You've worked too hard all this
afternoon, I'm afraid. Now we're going to sit down to a good
hot dinner, and tell Bob all about our preparations."</p>

<p>"M&mdash;m! Something smells good!" said Ruth. "I've been
so busy with all these cunning things that I haven't even
thought of eating. But now that you mention it, I'll admit
that I have a fine healthy appetite."</p>

<p>"Well, dinner is almost ready, and Bob will be here any
minute. It's all in the oven except the corn: meat loaf, sweet
potatoes and apricot cobbler."</p>

<p>"Oh, how good it sounds! More sensible than all our fluffy
dishes for the announcement luncheon. But then, I do love
fluffy things. I'm sure Alice will like it, and all the others,
too. Makes me 'most wish I'd kept my engagement a secret,
and announced it with ceremony as Alice is doing. But I
couldn't, somehow."</p>

<p>"No, you couldn't, Ruth, and neither could Fred. He'd give
it away if you didn't. So I guess there's no use wishing you
had kept it. Anyhow, you just suit me as you are. You've

<p>Mix the ground beef and salt pork, add the onion salt, fresh
crumbs, egg, salt, pepper and tomato. Mix thoroughly. Shape
into a loaf which will fit into a small buttered pan. Add the
water and pour fat drippings over the top. (Bacon fat is
good.) Cover the pan, and allow to cook in the oven one-half
hour. Uncover the loaf, basting frequently, and brown it.
This will take fifteen or twenty minutes. Serve hot. More
water may be added while cooking if necessary.</p>

<h2>CHAPTER LVII</h2>

<div class='chaptertitle'>A RAINBOW ANNOUNCEMENT LUNCHEON</div>


<div class='cap'>"OH, Bettina, how lovely!" cried the ten guests in a
chorus, as Ruth and Bettina ushered them into the
softly lighted dining-room. Not one had had even a glimpse
of the luncheon table before, for Ruth had been entertaining
them on the porch while Bettina put on the finishing touches.
It all seemed a burst of soft rainbow colors. "What is it?"
cried someone. "How did you ever get the rainbow effect?"</div>

<p>"Let's not examine it too closely," said Bettina. "You know
a rainbow after all is nothing but drops of water with the sun
shining through, and maybe my rainbow table has a prosy
explanation, too."</p>

<p>From the low mass of variegated garden flowers in the
center&mdash;pink, yellow, lavender, orange, blue, and as many others
as the girls could find&mdash;ran strips of soft tulle in rainbow
colors. The strips were attached at the outer end to the dainty
butterflies which perched lightly on the tulle covered candy
cups. These candy cups held pink, lavender and green Jordan
almond candies. More butterflies in all sizes and colors hovered
among the flowers. Upon the plain white name cards,
little butterflies had been outlined in black and decorated in
butterfly colors. Ruth and Bettina had cut with the scissors
around this outline and then, when it had been cut almost away,
had folded back the butterfly so that it stood up on the card,
as ready for flight as its brothers and sisters.</p>

<p>"Aren't they cunning?" exclaimed Barbara, taking her butterfly
from her favor cup. "Goodness, it's attached to something!"<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_194" id="Page_194">[194]</a></span>
Pulling gently by the rainbow tulle to which the butterfly
had been pasted, she drew forth from the greenery in
the center a little golden bag. It was in reality a little fat bag
of soft yellow silk tied with gold cord and holding something
that, seen through the mesh, appeared to be&mdash;gold?</p>

<p>The other girls, in great excitement, drew forth their little
bags.</p>

<p>"Rice!" declared Mary, "though it looks yellow!"</p>

<p>"It's the bag of gold at the foot of the rainbow!" exclaimed
Ruth, with flushed cheeks. "Discovered by&mdash;&mdash;"</p>

<p>"Harry Harrison and Alice!" cried the girls, laughing almost
hysterically. For one small card which read, "Discovered
by" and the two names, in gold letters, was tied to the
little bag by the gold cord.</p>

<p>"Alice, how did you ever manage to keep it a secret?" asked
someone.</p>

<p>"Well, it would have been harder if you had all known
Harry, but you see, we haven't been with the crowd much
lately, have we? Now admit it! You haven't even missed
me!"</p>

<p>"But you're more of a butterfly than any of the rest of us.
And the limits of the old crowd don't always bound your
flutterings."</p>

<p>"I'm not a butterfly anymore," said Alice. "I suppose I'll
have a butterfly wedding (Harry will detest it, but he'll have
to give in that once), but after that I expect to be as domestic
as Bettina here, though not such a success at it, probably.
Aren't these orange baskets the prettiest things?"</p>

<p>The girls, in their excitement, had almost forgotten to eat,
but now they looked down at their plates. Fruit cups in orange
baskets, with handles of millinery wire twisted with pink,
green, yellow and violet tulle, added to the rainbow effect.
The baskets were placed on paper doilies on tea plates, and
were artistically lined with mint leaves.</p>

<p>"It looks too pretty to eat," said Dorothy.</p>

<p>"Ruth will feel hurt if you don't like it, but I know you
will," said Bettina. "She prepared this course, and made most
of the table decorations, too."</p><p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_195" id="Page_195">[195]</a></span></p>

<p>"And didn't you wish that you were announcing something
yourself, Ruth?" asked Mary. "Although I don't believe the
crowd could stand two such surprises! We've known Fred
and you so long that your engagement seems the natural thing,
but when a perfectly strange man like Mr. Harrison happens
by, and helps himself to one of our number&mdash;well, it certainly
takes my breath away! Where did you first meet him, Alice?
Was it love at first sight?"</p>

<p>"Love at first sight? Bob introduced us&mdash;here, in this very
house, and I thought&mdash;well&mdash;I thought Harry the most disagreeably
serious man I'd ever had the misfortune to meet!
And he thought me the most disagreeably frivolous girl he
had ever seen! So our feud began, and of course we had to
see each other to fight it out!"</p>

<p>"And then comes Bettina's rainbow luncheon to show us
how serious the feud proved to be," laughed Barbara. "What?
More courses, Bettina? This is a beautiful luncheon! I wonder
who'll be the next to discover the treasure at the foot of the
rainbow?"</p>

<p>The menu consisted of:</p>

<div class='menu'>

<div class='ingredients1'>
1½ <abbr title="cup">C</abbr>-tuna<br />

<p>Mix all the ingredients together thoroughly, picking the fish
apart with a silver fork. Mould firmly in a loaf. Roll in
flour, and place in a buttered bread pan. Dot with butter, and
bake thirty minutes in a moderate oven. This same recipe
may be distributed among fancy individual moulds, filled half
full. Arrange a star-shaped piece of pimento, green pepper,
beet or egg in the bottom of a fancy aluminum mould. An
attractive design may be made by putting the star cut from
any vegetable with radiating pieces of any other kind of vegetable
of a different color. Place the design firmly on the
fish. Set the moulds in a pan of hot water and bake until the
mixture is firmly set. (About thirty minutes.) Remove from
the oven, let moulds stand three minutes, and then, with the
assistance of a knife, slip them from the pan, unmould all the
moulds in one flat pan, and keep them hot until needed. Do
not forget that the mould must be thoroughly buttered before
using. When ready to serve, make a regular vegetable white
sauce (two <abbr title="tablespoon">T</abbr>-butter, 2 <abbr title="tablespoon">T</abbr>-flour, 1 <abbr title="cup">C</abbr>-milk, ¼ <abbr title="teaspoon">t</abbr>-salt). When
ready to serve and while steaming hot, add one beaten egg
yoke. The hot sauce will cook the egg. Pour around the

<h2>CHAPTER LVIII</h2>

<div class='chaptertitle'>AN EARLY CALLER</div>


<div class='cap'>BOB had scarcely left the house the next morning when
Bettina was called to the door. "I couldn't resist coming!"
said Alice. "The announcement party was lovely, and I
must thank you for doing it. Aren't you tired to pieces?"</div>

<p>"No, Ruth helped me a great deal, and by the time Bob
came home to dinner, the luncheon dishes were washed and
put away and the house was in apple-pie order."</p>

<p>"Everything tasted delicious, Bettina. Maybe it sounds altogether
too practical for my own announcement party, but
I'm armed with a pencil and a notebook, and I do want to
get some of those recipes of yours!"</p>

<p>"You're welcome to them all, Alice, of course. They are
all recipes that I have used over and over again, and I'm
sure of them."</p>

<p>"What kind of soup was it? Celery? I thought so. Wasn't
it hard to prepare?"</p>

<p>"Why, Alice, it was canned celery soup, diluted with hot
milk. Then I added a teaspoonful of chopped parsley and a
teaspoonful of chopped red pepper."</p>

<p>"But surely it had whipped cream in it, Bettina!"</p>

<p>"Yes, I put a teaspoonful of whipped cream in the bottom
of the bouillon cup and poured the hot soup on it, so that it
would be well mixed."</p>

<p>"Well, that accounts for it; I thought it must be made with
whipped cream. Oh, Bettina, everything was so pretty! The

of it?"</p>

<p>"Well, butterflies are a happy choice for decorations! They
can be put anywhere, and they are easy to make&mdash;at least
Ruth says so."</p>

<p>"You use paper doilies a great deal, don't you! Aren't they
expensive?"</p>

<p>"Expensive? Well, I wish you'd price them! They are so
inexpensive that I like to use them even for a very informal
meal; they add such a dainty touch, I think."</p>

<p>"I must write down the recipes for your tuna loaf, and green
peppers stuffed with cauliflower, and Russian dressing&mdash;and
oh, that wonderful kind of rainbow dessert! Bettina, what
was that dessert?"</p>

<p>"Marshmallow cream made with gelatine and cream and
marshmallows and whites of eggs. I puzzled a long time over
a real 'rainbow' dessert, and finally decided on marshmallow
cream with a few variations. Come into the kitchen, where
I keep my card index, and I'll get all the recipes for you."</p>

<div class='recipetitle'><b>Potato Balls</b> (Four portions)</div>

<p>Boil potatoes of uniform size with the skins on. When cold,

<div class='recipetitle'><b>Marshmallow Cream</b> (Four portions)</div>

<div class='ingredients1'>
2 <abbr title="teaspoon">t</abbr>-granulated gelatin<br />
4 <abbr title="tablespoon">T</abbr>-cold milk<br />
<span class='small'><sup>2</sup>/<sub>3</sub></span> <abbr title="cup">C</abbr>-sugar<br />
1<span class='small'><sup>1</sup>/<sub>3</sub></span> <abbr title="cup">C</abbr>-double cream<br />
1 <abbr title="teaspoon">t</abbr>-vanilla extract<br />
1 egg white well beaten<br />
1 <abbr title="teaspoon">t</abbr>-lemon extract<br />
¼ <abbr title="pound">lb.</abbr> marshmallows, cut in one-fourth cubes<br />
4 toasted marshmallows<br />
4 pecans<br />
4 almonds<br />
</div>

<p>Soften the gelatin in milk for five minutes, and dissolve by
setting the dish in boiling water. Add the sugar. Allow the
mixture to cool. When it begins to congeal, add the flavorings.
Beat in the whipped cream, and continue beating until
it is firm. Fold in the egg-white and the marshmallows cut
in cubes. When the mixture begins to set, pile lightly in
sherbet cups. Place one-half of a toasted marshmallow on
the top, and arrange pecan meats and candied cherries in a
conventional design. Set aside one hour to cool and harden.</p>

<p>Bettina colored the mixture with vegetable coloring of a
very delicate green. Then on the top she placed a teaspoonful
of white whipped cream, then the toasted marshmallow and
the different fruits. Bettina browned the marshmallows
quickly in the oven, after she had cut them the desired shape.
She used cups with handles, and decorated them with fluffy
bows of variegated tulles. To make these bows, she took strips
of each color desired, one inch wide, tied them together, and
"fluffed them out." She might have gained a real rainbow
effect by dividing the marshmallow cream (when mixed, but
not yet firm) into three bowls, and coloring them green, lavender
and pink, with delicate vegetable colors. Then, having
beaten in the whipped cream, she might have placed in each
sherbet cup three layers, pink, lavender and green. Then, on
the top, she might have placed the whipped cream.</p><hr class="chap" /><p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_200" id="Page_200">[200]</a></span></p>




<h2>CHAPTER LIX</h2>

<div class='chaptertitle'>RUTH COMES TO LUNCHEON</div>


<div class='cap'>"AND here we are, busily planning Alice's affairs," said
Bettina, "when we might be talking of yours, Ruth.
Are you sure, sure, sure, that you don't want any parties, or
showers, or affairs of any sort?"</div>

<p>"Sure, sure, sure!" said Ruth, emphatically. "I may be
silly, Bettina, but to me such a fuss beforehand takes something
away from the beauty of the wedding! And then there
are other reasons. We've had to postpone building till next
summer, and may not be married till the house is done&mdash;you
know that. So we'll have been engaged a long time. It seems
to me that after a long engagement like ours, it is better to
have a simple wedding and no parties. Alice's is happening
just as I always expected that it would&mdash;a surprising announcement,
a short engagement, and many parties, with an elaborate
wedding as the climax! Sometimes I think that sort would
be the kind to have&mdash;but you see, Bettina, when you're expecting
to be married only once, you want to have just the kind
that seems best to you."</p>

<p>"And yours will be just right for you, Ruth," said Bettina,
warmly. "You are you, and Fred is Fred, and I can't imagine
either of you caring for much excitement. And when you are
in your new house&mdash;&mdash;"</p>

<p>"I'm going to have you over at least once a week to just
such a dear little luncheon as this! Or rather&mdash;as much like
it as I can devise. Bettina, how did you have time to cook
such good things?"</p>

<p>"Well," said Bettina, "Bob will have these same things for<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_201" id="Page_201">[201]</a></span>
dinner tonight, with the addition of some cold sliced meat. So
now, Ruth, we have a long afternoon before us&mdash;to sew and

<h2>CHAPTER LX</h2>

<div class='chaptertitle'>A KITCHEN SHOWER FOR ALICE</div>


<div class="image-left">
<img src="images/oi_207.jpg" width="270" height="260" alt="Two women with shopping baskets over their arms" />
</div>

<div class='unindent'><span class='letter'>"D</span>ID you want me for
something, Mary?" asked
Alice at the door. "Mother said
you had telephoned."</div>

<p>"Come in! Come in!" cried
ten girls at once, while Bettina
whispered to Ruth: "Thank
goodness, she's come! The muffins
are all but done!"</p>

<p>"What in the world!" said
Alice.</p>

<p>"A party for you!"</p>

<p>"And I'm wearing my old suit!"</p>

<p>"We caught you this time, but never mind. Come in, and
take off your things."</p>

<p>As soon as Alice reappeared in the living room, a small table
was drawn up before the open fire. Two girls appeared, wearing
gingham aprons and carrying overflowing market baskets.</p>

<p>"This is a kitchen shower for you, Alice," Ruth explained
somewhat ceremoniously. "But if you are willing, we will use
the utensils in serving the luncheon and afterwards present
them to you. May we unpack the baskets?"</p>

<p>"Do," said Alice, laughing.</p>

<p>From the larger basket, Ruth removed twelve white enamelled
plates of different sizes (suitable for holding supplies in
the refrigerator), and twelve cross-barred tea towels. The<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_206" id="Page_206">[206]</a></span>
latter she passed around to be used as napkins, and Mary distributed
the plates. On the small serving table before the fire,
a white muslin table cover was placed. As she unfolded it,
Ruth read from the attached card:</p>

<div class='poem'>
"If breakfast you should chance to eat<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">Upon the kitchen table&mdash;</span><br />
I'll make it dainty, fair and neat<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">So far as I am able."</span><br />
</div>

<p>When the steel forks and spoons of various sizes were taken
out and passed around, two glass measuring cups were found
to hold loaf sugar wrapped in frilled paper. Upon one of
these Ruth read:</p>

<div class='poem'>
"Please eat us all, but let your sweet<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">Sweet hours be duly treasured,</span><br />
For we belie the worldly eye&mdash;<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">True sweetness can't be measured."</span><br />
</div>

<p>A glass rolling-pin filled with stick candy came next, and
its sentiments read, and meanwhile the girls had begun to read
aloud the advice pinned upon the tea-towels, such as:</p>

<div class='poem'>
"No matter what his whims and wishes&mdash;<br />
<span style="margin-left: 0.5em;">Just tell him he must wipe the dishes!"</span><br />
</div>

<div class='unindent'>and</div>

<div class='poem'>
"But if he breaks a cup or plate,<br />
<span style="margin-left: 0.5em;">Just throw the pieces at him straight."</span><br />
</div>

<p>"What vindictive dish-towels!" said Alice. "They're not a
bit sentimental!"</p>

<p>When the contents had been removed and all the verses read,
the large basket was presented to Alice, who read from its
handle:</p><p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_207" id="Page_207">[207]</a></span></p>

<div class='poem'>
"To market, to market, to buy your supplies!<br />
You'll go there in person, if careful and wise."<br />
</div>

<p>"I will, Mr. Basket, with you over my arm!" answered
Alice.</p>

<p>Meanwhile the girls had carried in the salad in an earthenware
mixing-bowl, the muffins heaped high in a small basket
with a dainty dustcloth over them, the coffee in a large enamelled
pitcher, and the "molasses puffs" wrapped in frilled
paper in a basket suitable for holding supplies. "Bettina's
apples" were arranged in two flat enamelled pans. All the food
was served informally from the small table, and the merriment
grew as the luncheon progressed.</p>

<p>"I wish that all the meals Harry and I have together might
be as jolly as this one! I'm sure I should be glad to eat always
from kitchen dishes, if that is what makes the fun," said
Alice.</p>

<p>At the kitchen shower, the luncheon was as follows:</p>

<div class='menu'>

a little is dropped into cold water. Pour the syrup slowly
over the stiffly beaten egg whites. Beat vigorously until cool

icing gets hard before it is cool, add two tablespoons of water

<p>"It was raining so that I decided to build a cozy little fire

<p>"Well, I'm glad you're here! I was expecting to come home

<p>"And I expected not to see you till midnight, so I'm well

a 'pick-up meal.' I expected to eat only a lunch myself."</p>

<p>"I don't care what you give me, just so it's hot. My walk
through the rain has given me an appetite. I'll help you get
supper and wash the dishes, Bettina, and then afterward we'll
pop corn and toast marshmallows by the fire. What do you
say?"</p>

<p>"Fine, Bob! I cooked some celery today&mdash;just a little&mdash;and
I think I'll fix 'celery au gratin' for you. The cooky-jar

<p>"A full cooky-jar! Bettina, that ought to be the symbol of
our happy home. May it always be full!"</p>

are at my mercy&mdash;for I have prepared this humble repast
with my own useless hands!"</div>

<p>"Shame on you, Alice! Don't pretend to be so humble.
You do everything so easily that I'll not be surprised to see
you papering your own house and acting as your own plumber
and doing every other hard thing. A useless butterfly like
you who turns out to be so competent after all is the despair
of all us plodders who have always plodded and always will!"
And Ruth sighed.</p>

<p>"Never mind, Ruthie," said Bettina. "I've eaten a mighty
fine luncheon that you cooked yourself&mdash;four or five courses,
if I haven't forgotten!"</p>

<p>"Yes, and I worried every minute during that day!"</p>

<p>"We all do at first, except maybe Alice!"</p>

<p>"Why worry?" said Alice. "(Seems to me I've heard that
expression before.) You girls won't die if the biscuits do
fail&mdash;I'll give you bread. Harry and I are going to laugh at
our own mistakes&mdash;and enjoy them. Isn't that a good philosophy?
But, girls, to get down to biscuits. I want to ask
you&mdash;one and all&mdash;collectively and individually, to be in my
wedding party. With the addition of Sister, who isn't here.
She and Bettina will be the matrons of honor. Will you?"</p><p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_213" id="Page_213">[213]</a></span></p>

egg in six long petals. Arrange these on the salad.
Cut the yolks in half, and place in the center&mdash;round side

<h2>CHAPTER LXIII</h2>

<div class='chaptertitle'>MOTORING WITH THE DIXONS</div>


<div class='cap'>"NOT through dinner yet?" exclaimed the Dixons at
the door. "May we sit down and wait? It's a beautiful
evening, and we've come to get you to take a long drive
with us."</div>

<p>"Fine," said Bob. "Come out to the dining-room and talk
till we're through."</p>

<p>"And then I'll help Bettina clear off the table," said Charlotte.
"Well, people, it looks like a good dinner, and Sherlock
Holmes deduces, moreover, that you had roast lamb
yesterday for your Sunday dinner."</p>

<p>"You might also deduce that we had baked potatoes, from
which these creamed ones are made," laughed Bettina. "Nothing
else to guess at, except that part of a cabbage made cold
slaw yesterday and escalloped cabbage today. And my dessert,
while simple, has no secret past," she added as she removed
the first course. "A plain and simple custard, that's
all."</p>

<p>"Suits me," said Bob, heartily, "especially when it's cold
like this."</p>

<p>"By the way, Bettina," said Charlotte, "did you ever get rid
of those black ants you were telling me about?"</p>

<p>"Yes, I've never seen one since."</p>

<p>"Well, you know how worried I was about the little red
ones that bothered me. Aunt Isabel, in a letter, gave me a
remedy that has worked like magic."</p>

<p>"Aunt Isabel has her uses, after all," teased Frank.</p><p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_216" id="Page_216">[216]</a></span></p>

<p>"I should say she has! She knows all about housekeeping,
from A to Z! Her remedy sounds queer, but I can vouch
for its efficacy, so if anyone ever asks you what to do for red
ants, you tell them this, Bettina. I took some covers from
baking powder cans, and some Mason jar covers, and some
pie tins, and chalked the sides well with common school crayon.
Then I set them on the pantry shelves to hold dishes of whatever
kinds of food the ants liked. The ants never climbed
over those chalked covers and soon they had all disappeared.
I don't have to use the chalked tins any more, but if I ever
see a red ant in my pantry again, I'll get out the chalk."</p>

<p>"Couldn't you make a heavy chalk mark on the shelf paper
around the dish of food?" asked Bob.</p>

<p>"I tried that, but it didn't do any good. But the other way
worked beautifully."</p>

<p>"I'm glad to know about it," said Bettina. "Well, Bob, are
you ready? It will take only a few minutes to carry out the
dishes and pile them up. I'm sorry we've kept you people
waiting."</p>

<p>For dinner that night they had:</p>

<h2>CHAPTER LXIV</h2>

<div class='chaptertitle'>RUTH MAKES BAKING POWDER BISCUITS</div>


<div class='cap'>"OH, Ruth!" called Bettina from her door to Ruth, who
was walking past. "Come in and stay to dinner!"</div>

<p>"My dear, I'd love to, but&mdash;&mdash;"</p>

<p>"I'm going to have baking powder biscuits, and I remember
that you were longing to learn how to make them."</p>

<p>"Oh, Bettina! Would you really show me? I'll simply
have to come, then. I hesitated because Aunt Martha is here,
but I know she'll excuse me for one evening. What time is
it? Five? I'll take these packages home and be back in fifteen
minutes!"</p>

<p>When Ruth returned she found Bettina in her kitchen with
all of the ingredients for the biscuits set out on the table.</p>

<p>"Perhaps two cups of flour will make too many for three
people," she said, "but Bob has a good-sized appetite these
crisp fall days, and he's fond of biscuits with jelly. Now,
Ruth, you can get to work! Sift the flour, baking powder
and salt together, and then cut the lard in this way with this
knife.... Fine! Now add the milk very slowly&mdash;perhaps
it will take a little more than two-thirds of a cup, it all depends
on the flour. There! Now pat the dough into shape on this
floured board, and then you can cut the biscuits out with this
little cutter. Yes, about three-fourths of an inch thick. Ruth,
those look fine! We'll wait a little while to bake them, they're
better perfectly fresh. Set them out in the cold, there, until
I have fixed the macaroni, and they can pop into the oven at
the same time."</p>

<p>"That was so easy, Bettina. I do hope those biscuits will
be good!"</p><p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_219" id="Page_219">[219]</a></span></p>

<p>"Don't wait, then. (Say, these are my favorite potatoes,
all right!) Well, what about the wedding? All the gowns

you picture them in your mind, Bob?"</p>

<p>"Not exactly, but then, go on."</p>

<p>"Well, they're nearly finished. I saw them today, and
they're lovely. The girls are to carry lavender maline muffs,
too&mdash;the round kind with fluffy bows at each end, and little
pink rosebuds around the hand, you know. Then a corsage
bouquet of violets with a pink rose in the center will be pinned
on each muff. The bridesmaids will also wear lavender maline
hats, with fluffy tarn o' shanter crowns and pink rosebuds
around them."</p>

<p>"Is that what you'll wear?"</p>

<p>"No, Lillian and I are the matrons of honor, and we will be
all in white, with white muffs, and corsage bouquets of pink
roses on them. Won't that be lovely? I don't know yet
whether Lillian's little Elizabeth, who will scatter rose petals
from a fluffy long-handled basket, is to wear pink or white.
Oh, I wish you might have seen the girls this afternoon! We

<h2>CHAPTER LXVI</h2>

<div class='chaptertitle'>A GUEST TO A DINNER OF LEFT-OVERS</div>


<div class='cap'>"AHA, I've found you out!" Bettina heard a laughing
voice shout as she hurried up the steps.</div>

<p>"Why, Jack, when did you come to town?"</p>

<p>"This afternoon. Went to Bob's office the very first thing,
and he insisted on bringing me home with him to dinner. I
told him it might 'put you out,' but he spent the time it took
to come home assuring me that you were always waiting for
company&mdash;kept a light ever burning in the window for them
and all that. He said that I'd see,&mdash;that you'd be on the doorstep
waiting for us!"</p>

<p>"And after all that&mdash;you weren't here!" said Bob reproachfully.</p>

<p>"I'm just as sorry as I can be not to live up to Bob's picture
of me," said Bettina. "I generally am waiting for Bob,&mdash;almost
on the doorstep if not quite. But this afternoon I've
been to a shower for Alice,&mdash;do you remember Alice, Jack?"</p>

<p>"Very well. The gay dark-eyed one. You don't mean to
say that she's found a man who's lively enough to suit her?"</p>

<p>"Well, she seems to be suited, all right. But I must fly into
an apron if you boys are to get any dinner within a half-hour.
Jack, you'll have to pardon me if after all of Bob's eloquence
I give you a meal of left-overs&mdash;&mdash;"</p>

<p>"Don't apologize to a bachelor, Bettina. He probably won't
know left-overs from the real thing," said Bob.</p>

<p>"Bachelors are said to be the most critical of all," she answered.
"But I'll do my little best to please."</p>

<h2>CHAPTER LXVII</h2>

<div class='chaptertitle'>A HANDKERCHIEF SHOWER</div>


<div class='cap'>"WHAT a cunning table!" exclaimed four girls in various
words and ways. Ruth and Bettina smiled happily
to each other, for they, too, had admired the low bowl
of purple and yellow pansies in the center, and the tiny individual
vases for a few pansies at each place. The dainty
doilies were also attractive, and Ruth had darkened the room
and lit the small yellow candles on the table.</div>

<p>"But Bettina helped with the soufflé and the gold hearts,"
she said gallantly. "Did you see her disappear a short time
ago? She was baking the cakes. When she suggested refreshments
that should be made just before they were served, I
was frightened. But when she offered to bake the things,
you may be sure I was delighted."</p>

<p>At this moment a small figure appeared in the doorway.
"Weady, Cousin Wuth?"</p>

<p>"Yes, dear."</p>

<p>In popped little Marjorie, Ruth's cousin, carrying a huge
bouquet of handkerchiefs folded like white roses, fastened
somehow to long stems with green leaves attached, tied with
streaming yellow satin ribbon. Making a low bow to Alice,
she recited in a baby voice:</p>

<div class='poem'>
"A handkerchief posie to carry each day.<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1.5em;">We trust they will not come amiss,</span><br />
<span style="margin-left: 0.5em;">In fact, we are sure that no other bouquet</span><br />
<span style="margin-left: 1.5em;">Was ever so useful as this!"</span><br />
</div>

<p>"Thank you, you darling!" said Alice, receiving the gift with
delight.</p><p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_225" id="Page_225">[225]</a></span></p>

<div class='recipetitle'><b>Apricot Soufflé (Soo-Flay) "Lightened with Air"</b> (Six portions)</div>

6 candied cherries<br />
</div>

<p>Wash the dried apricots and soak for three hours in sufficient
water to cover them. Cook slowly until tender (about
ten minutes) in the same water in which they were soaked.
Press through a colander, add the sugar and cook until very
thick, stirring constantly to prevent burning. Add salt and
extract. Allow to cool. Beat the egg whites until very stiff,
add the baking-powder, apricots and vanilla. Stir just
enough to mix. Pour into well buttered individual tin or
aluminum moulds until two-thirds full. Place the moulds in
a pan of hot water and bake thirty-five minutes in a slow oven.
Turn off the fire and allow the pans to remain in a warm
place so that they will not fall. When slightly cool, remove
carefully and serve as quickly as possible. Place whipped
cream and a candied cherry on the top.</p>


<div class='recipetitle'><b>Whipped Cream</b> (Six portions)</div>

<div class='ingredients1'>

<p>Cream the butter, add the sugar, and mix well. Add the
egg yolks, beaten well, and the water, milk, flour, baking-powder,
lemon extract and salt. Beat for two minutes. Pour
into a large flat pan prepared with waxed paper. The batter
should be three-fourths of an inch thick in the pan. Bake
twelve minutes in a moderate oven. Remove the paper, and
cut when cool with a heart-shaped cooky cutter. Wet the
cutter with water before using, as this assures even edges.
Keep in a moist place until ready to serve.</p>

<h2>CHAPTER LXVIII</h2>

<div class='chaptertitle'>JUST THE TWO OF THEM</div>


<div class='cap'>"IT seems good to be alone this evening, doesn't it, Bettina?"
said Bob, as they sat down to dinner. "Or are
you growing so accustomed to gaiety lately that a dinner for
two is a bore?"</div>

<p>"Bob!" said Bettina reproachfully. "If I thought you really
believed that I was ever bored by a dinner for the two of
us,&mdash;well, I'd never be in a wedding party again! Alice likes
excitement, and I suppose that next week will be very gay, but
after the wedding I hope that you and I can have a quiet
winter, with just invitations enough to keep us from becoming
too stupid."</p>

<p>"But tell me what the wedding will be like. Is it all planned
down to the last detail? I suppose it is, although Harry
doesn't seem to have any idea what it is to be."</p>

<p>"Poor Harry, he seems to be left out of most of the showers
and parties so far."</p>

<p>"Don't pity him; he wouldn't go if he could. I'm just
wondering what they'll do after the wedding. Will Alice
go and Harry stay at home? Or, will he be obliging and force
himself to go, too?"</p>

<p>"I don't know, I'm sure. Alice is so full of life that I don't
see how she can settle down and never go anywhere, as Harry
would have her. But time will tell. Perhaps they'll compromise.
Meanwhile, we must plan some sort of a shower or
prenuptial party that Harry can enjoy, too. One with the men
included, I mean. Of course, I know he hates parties, but I<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_228" id="Page_228">[228]</a></span>
think he would really like a very jolly informal one with just
a few friends!"</p>

<p>The dinner for two consisted of:</p>

<h2>CHAPTER LXIX</h2>

<div class='chaptertitle'>A LUNCHEON IN THE COUNTRY</div>


<div class='cap'>"OH, Charlotte, I've just come from the loveliest luncheon,"
said Bettina, coming face to face with Mrs.
Dixon in front of her own home.</div>

<p>"You have? Another for Alice?"</p>

<p>"No, this was in the country&mdash;on the interurban, at Cousin
Kate's. Frances, her daughter, who was married last spring,
has come home on a visit, and Cousin Kate was entertaining
for her."</p>

<p>"Tell me about it!"</p>

<p>"Oh, it was just an informal luncheon, but I couldn't help
thinking how delicious everything was, and at the same time
inexpensive. In fact, I wrote down several of Cousin Kate's
recipes after the guests had gone, and I'm sure that there
aren't many such inexpensive luncheons that are also so good."</p>

<p>"You must let me have some of the recipes."</p>

<p>"Of course I will. Come in now, and copy them."</p>

<p>"I can't possibly, Bettina. As it is, I'm afraid that Frank
will be home before I am. It's almost six o'clock now."</p>

<p>"Is it? Then I must hurry in and start dinner; I want to
make some muffins. I hate to have Bob eat a cold dinner
just because I've been out in the afternoon; in fact, I usually
spend more time than usual in the morning fixing some dessert
that he especially likes, if I'm to be out in the afternoon.
Good-bye, Charlotte!"</p>

<h2>CHAPTER LXX</h2>

<div class='chaptertitle'>A "PAIR SHOWER" FOR ALICE</div>


<div class='cap'>WHEN Bettina called the girls into the dining-room after
several hours spent in hemming dish towels for Alice,
they exclaimed that the time had passed so quickly. The
table was set for twelve, and the chair at the right of the
hostess was gaily decorated with white ribbon and white paper
flowers.</div>

<p>"Oh, for me?" cried Alice. "How important I feel!"</p>

<p>As soon as the girls were seated, Ruth rose and placed before
the guest of honor a large wicker basket heaped high
with packages of all shapes and sizes, each wrapped in white
tissue paper and tied with white ribbon. A card hung from
the handle of the basket. "I'll read it aloud!" laughed Alice.</p>

<div class='poem'>
"Dear Alice, we have tried to choose<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1.5em;">Some gifts for you that come by twos.</span><br />
<span style="margin-left: 0.5em;">A few, perhaps, you'll often use,</span><br />
<span style="margin-left: 1.5em;">While some may comfort and amuse,</span><br />
<span style="margin-left: 0.5em;">If you should chance to get the blues,</span><br />
<span style="margin-left: 1.5em;">When household cares your mind confuse.</span><br />
<br />
"This basket, which our blessing bears,<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1.5em;">Besides the gifts that come in pairs,</span><br />
<span style="margin-left: 0.5em;">Our friendship and our love declares.</span><br />
<span style="margin-left: 1.5em;">'Twill share your troubles and your cares</span><br />
<span style="margin-left: 0.5em;">And hold the hose that Harry wears.</span><br />
<span style="margin-left: 1.5em;">So keep them free from holes and tears."</span><br />
</div>

<p>"Goodness!" cried Alice. "The thought of my future cares<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_233" id="Page_233">[233]</a></span>
frightens me! But now I must open all the packages!"</p>

<p>She discovered a salt and pepper shaker, a pair of guest
towels, a pair of hose, a sugar bowl and a creamer, and many
other gifts in pairs. It was a long time before the girls could
calm down sufficiently to eat the luncheon that Bettina, with
Ruth's assistance, set before them.</p>

<p>Mix the tuna, celery, eggs, sweet pickle, pepper, salt and

to mash salads.) Add the salad dressing; more than a cup
may be necessary. Keep very cold, and serve attractively on
a lettuce leaf.</p>

slowly into the dry ingredients. Mix thoroughly and pour
into two well-buttered bread pans. Allow to stand fifteen
minutes and bake forty minutes in a moderate oven. When

(allowing remainder to stay in water) and remove the skins.
Prepare all the peanuts the same way. Place two tablespoons
of oil in the frying pan, when hot add the peanuts; stir constantly
with a fork and cook over a moderate fire fifteen minutes.
When brown remove the nuts, add another tablespoon
of oil and another third of the peanuts, continue until all the
nuts are cooked. Add the salt. Lard may be used in place
of oil, but the latter makes the nuts taste and brown better.</p><hr class="chap" /><p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_235" id="Page_235">[235]</a></span></p>

<h2>CHAPTER LXXII</h2>

<div class='chaptertitle'>AND WHERE WAS THE DINNER?</div>


<div class='cap'>"HELLO!" called Bob at the door one evening.</div>

<p>No answer.</p>

<p>"Hello, Bettina!" he called again. Again the dark house
gave forth no reply.</p>

<p>Feeling, it must be admitted, a little out of harmony with a
world that allowed weary and hungry husbands to come home
to dark and empty houses when the clock said plainly that it
was a quarter after six, Bob made his way to the kitchen.
Perhaps Bettina had left his dinner there for him; perhaps
she had been called away, or perhaps, even, she had rushed
out on some errand after dinner preparations were begun.
The kitchen, however, was so immaculate as to seem distinctly
forbidding to a hungry man whose appetite was growing
keener every minute. And he had been thinking all the way
home that a hot dinner would taste so good!</p>

<p>At that moment a clamor of voices at the door aroused him.</p>

<p>"You poor old Bob!" cried Bettina, kissing him twice before
Fred and Ruth without the least embarrassment. "Have you
waited long?"</p>

<p>"It seemed hours," admitted Bob.</p>

<p>"Ruth and I have been to a tea for Alice. Fred came for
her there, and I persuaded them to come home to dinner with
me. I'll give you each something to do while I stir up a little
cottage pudding. Then dinner will be ready in half an hour."</p>

<p>"Half an hour?" cried Bob. "But, Bettina, where is the
dinner? I didn't see any!"</p>

<p>"In the fireless cooker, you crazy boy! Are you 'most
starved?"</p><p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_238" id="Page_238">[238]</a></span></p>

<p>"Well," said Bob, "that cooker was the neatest, stiffest-looking
thing in the kitchen! I didn't dream that it was
busily cooking a dinner. Say, I'll be glad to see a hot meal
again!"</p>

<p>The dinner consisted of:</p>

<p>Pound the flour into the round steak with the edge of a
small plate. This breaks the fibers of the meat, making it
more tender. Wash and peel the potatoes, slicing in half
lengthwise. Scrape the carrots, and cut into one-half inch
slices lengthwise. Wash the onions and remove their outside
skins. Sprinkle the vegetables with one and a half level teaspoons
of salt, and the paprika. Add the water, and place in
the bottom of the large fireless cooker utensil. Place the lard
in a frying pan, and when hot, add the meat. Brown thoroughly
on each side. Salt the meat with one-half level teaspoon
of salt, and place in the kettle on top of the vegetables.
Place the heated disks of the fireless cooker over and under
the utensil, and cook at least one hour in the cooker.</p>

<div class='chaptertitle'>ALICE TELLS HER TROUBLES</div>


<div class='cap'>"AND the minute I caught a glimpse of you, Bettina, at
the tea this afternoon, I thought, 'Oh, if Betty would
only ask me to go home with her to a sensible homelike dinner,
with no one there but herself and Bob&mdash;&mdash;'"</div>

<p>"Not even Harry, Alice?"</p>

<p>"No, not even Harry! I'm so sick and tired of teas and
dressmakers and wedding gowns and bridesmaids that I'm
tired even of Harry, too! Almost."</p>

<p>"But, Alice, then why do it all? Why have all this fuss and
feathers?" And Bettina's knife, with which she was cutting
bread, came down with a click of vehemence. "It has always
seemed silly to me&mdash;all the worry and bother&mdash;&mdash;"</p>

<p>"But what can I do now, Bettina? I've started, and I'll
have to go through with it! Why, even now, I ought to be
home for dinner&mdash;mother has several guests&mdash;but I phoned
her that I had a headache and was coming here, where I
could be quiet. And I do have a headache&mdash;and no appetite,

<div class='chaptertitle'>THE DIXONS COME TO DINNER</div>


<div class='cap'>"CHARLOTTE, you must have Bettina tell you how to
cook fish this way," said Frank.</div>

<p>"It's the Bechamel sauce on it that you like, I suspect," said
Bettina. "And it isn't at all hard to make. I serve it with
so many things. We like it with carrots&mdash;&mdash;"</p>

<p>"Oh, is it the very same sauce that you serve with carrots?"
said Charlotte. "I can make it, Frank. I'll have it for dinner
one of these days, with halibut, just as Bettina has served
it tonight."</p>

<p>"There is only one thing to think about especially in making
it," said Bettina. "After you have beaten the egg slightly, add
a very little of the hot liquid to it, and then pour the mixture
into the rest. Then cook it a short time, not long, as a sauce
made with egg sometimes separates."</p>

<p>"I'll remember," said Charlotte. "You do have such good
meals, Bettina. How do you manage it? Sometimes I can
think of the best things to cook, and other days I don't seem
to have a bit of imagination!"</p>

<p>"I plan my menu all out a week, and sometimes two weeks,
ahead," said Bettina. "It is really quite a complicated process,
as I want to have a variety, as well as inexpensive things that
are on the market. Of course, I may change my plans in
many details, but I keep to the general outline. Planning the
meals seems simple, but it really requires a lot of thinking
sometimes. Excuse me while I bring in the dessert. Bob, will

<h2>CHAPTER LXXV</h2>

<div class='chaptertitle'>THE WEDDING INVITATIONS</div>


<div class='cap'>BOB and Bettina had scarcely sat down to dinner one crisp
cold evening, when they heard laughing voices at the
door. "It sounds like Alice," said Bettina. "What can she
be up to now? And Harry, too!"</div>

<p>Bob had already thrown open the door, and there, as Bettina
had guessed, were Alice and Harry, each carrying a large box.</p>

<p>"We've come to deliver your invitation to the wedding," said
Alice. "It may be unconventional, but it's fun. The rest we
are going down to mail&mdash;that is, if we don't get frightened at
the idea, and pitch the boxes in the river instead."</p>

<p>"If that's the way you feel," said Harry firmly, "I'll carry
your box myself."</p>

<p>"Please don't, Harry! Just think, I may never have another
opportunity of mailing the invitations to my own wedding,
so don't deprive me of the privilege."</p>

<p>"Stay to dinner won't you?" said Bettina. "We had really
planned on having Uncle John and Aunt Mary this evening,
but they didn't come to town after all. So I am sure we have
plenty, even to apple dumplings for dessert."</p>

<p>"Harry had asked me to take dinner with him down town,"
said Alice, "by way of celebrating when these invitations were
mailed. But perhaps we might stay here instead, since this
was the very place in which we met first! Harry, I believe
sentiment demands that we accept Bettina's invitation."</p>

<p>"I must broil another steak," said Bettina, "but that will
take only a few minutes. I'm so glad you can stay."</p>

<p>"But we'll have to leave immediately after dinner," said<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_246" id="Page_246">[246]</a></span>

ago," said Bettina, "when I turn around suddenly and see a
jack-o'-lantern grinning in at the window! Don't you love
them?"</p>

<p>"Those are the Stewart children," said Bob. "They're just
hoping that I'll come out and chase them away! There's no
fun for them in having us like it too well! You girls ought
to give at least an imitation of a shriek apiece. You don't
have ladylike nerves at all!"</p>

<p>"Years and years and years and years!" said Ruth, laughing.
"Well, this party is in honor of Harry, so you mustn't
tell him anything about it&mdash;not even that we're giving it. And
Bob, I believe Fred would help make the jack-o'-lanterns."</p>

<p>"See here, Ruth," said Bob, "you want Fred to get half the

<h2>CHAPTER LXXVII</h2>

<div class='chaptertitle'>HALLOWE'EN REVELS</div>


<div class='poem'>
"Come, on mystic Hallowe'en,<br />
<span style="margin-left: 0.5em;">Let us seek the dreadful scene,</span><br />
<span style="margin-left: 0.5em;">Where the witches, imps and devils,</span><br />
<span style="margin-left: 0.5em;">Elves and ghosts will hold their revels!</span><br />
<span style="margin-left: 10em;">1107 Carberry Avenue.</span><br />
<span style="margin-left: 11.5em;">Seven o'clock."</span><br /><br />
</div>

<div class='cap'>THIS was the invitation received by Harry, Alice, Fred
and even Bob, who had an inkling of what was about to
happen, inasmuch as 1107 Carberry Avenue happened to be his
own address. At seven o'clock that evening Bob was nowhere
to be found. However, when four horribly disguised
figures were ushered into the house, the witch who pointed
the way up the stairs seemed satisfied. A few minutes later,
the ghosts and demons having removed such garments as were
needed only in the outer air, assembled in the weirdly lighted
living-room. All of the electric lights were covered with yellow
crêpe paper shades, with faces cut in them. Jack-o'-lanterns
stood in every conceivable place, and a fire burned
brightly in the open fireplace.</div>

<p>The two witches, who were evidently the hostesses, commenced
a weird chant in a minor key. The male ghosts, three
in number, immediately took up the music, if it could be so
called, howling in loud and uncanny tones. Thereupon the
witches beckoned the whole company with all speed to the
dining-room.</p>

<p>The table was a mass of color and light. Potatoes, carrots
and beets, with sticks for legs, held the lighted candles. At
each place were individual favors, witches holding the place
cards, and small Jack-o'-lanterns standing beside them. The<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_251" id="Page_251">[251]</a></span>
center of the table was a miniature field of pumpkins and cornstalks.</p>

<p>The place cards were read and the places were found. The
guest of honor, he who sat at the right of her who was evidently
"witch-in-charge," discovered the following on his card,
and the others were equally descriptive and illuminating:</p>

<div class='poem'>
This place is laid for one who soon<br />
<span style="margin-left: 3em;">Will marry!</span><br />
O youth bewitched by maid and moon,<br />
<span style="margin-left: 3em;">Be wary!</span><br />
But if you can't, then make it soon,<br />
<span style="margin-left: 3em;">Dear Harry!</span><br />
</div>

<p>The supper, decorative as well as delicious, was all upon the
table. Little individual pumpkin pies on paper doilies stood
beside each place. The salad caused much delight among the
guests, who at the invitation of the witches, had now removed
their masks. A large red apple with a face cut on the outside,
had been hollowed out, and the salad was within. On the top
of the apple was a round wafer with a marshmallow upon it
to represent a hat. The hat was further decorated with a
"stick-up" of stick candy on one side. The apple stood on a
leaf of lettuce, with a yellow salad dressing necktie. The
favor boxes, which were under the witches, were filled with
candy corn, while the popcorn balls, placed on a platter, had
features of chocolate fudge, and bonnets of frilled paper.</p>

<p>The supper menu was as follows:</p>

<div class='menu'>
Oyster Patties&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;Bettina's Surprise Salad<br />
Hallowe'en Sandwiches&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;  Pickles<br />
Pumpkin Pie<br />
Cider&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;   Doughnuts<br />
Jumbles&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;  Popcorn Balls<br />
</div>

<p>"Have another jumble, Harry," urged Ruth. "See, this one
has unusual eyes and a particularly soulful expression."</p>

<p>"I have already eaten so many that I fear my memory of this
party will be a jumble of faces! I'll see them in my sleep&mdash;all
with that soulful expression!"</p>

<p>"Another toasted marshmallow, Bettina?" asked Fred,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_252" id="Page_252">[252]</a></span>
thrusting it toward her on the end of a hat-pin. "This candle
is nearly burned out, so I'm afraid I can't offer you any
more."</p>

<p>"It is really time to bob for apples," said Bettina. "Who
ever heard of a Hallowe'en party without that! And we must
each try to bite the swinging doughnut, and then we must blindfold
each other and try to pin the tail on the unfortunate black
cat. Bob, will you carry this tub into the living-room? And
Ruth, will you remove the popcorn balls to the piano bench?
Perhaps someone will grow hungry from the exertion of these
games. And I know that later in the evening Alice, though a
guest, will tell our fortunes."</p>

<p>"Alice can tell my fortune by looking at her own hand," said
Harry. "Because she holds my happiness there."</p>

<p>"What a sentimental sentence, Harry!" said Fred, looking
amazed. "See, you've embarrassed us all!"</p>

<p>"Well, I'm always being called cold and reserved, and I've
decided to turn over a new leaf."</p>

<p>"Oh, Harry, don't be so foolish!" said Alice, who had grown
as red as the apples on the table. "It's time for games!"</p>


<div class='bettina'>BETTINA'S RECIPES</div>

<div class='level'>(All measurements are level)</div>


<div class='recipetitle'><b>Oyster Patties</b> (Six portions)</div>

<div class='ingredients1'>
3 <abbr title="tablespoon">T</abbr>-butter<br />
4 <abbr title="tablespoon">T</abbr>-flour<br />
1 <abbr title="cup">C</abbr>-milk<br />

<span class='small'><sup>1</sup>/<sub>8</sub></span> <abbr title="teaspoon">t</abbr>-paprika<br />
½ pint of oysters<br />
</div>

<p>Clean the oysters by removing any shells, and drain off the
liquor. Melt the butter, add the flour and salt, and mix thoroughly.
Gradually add the milk, stirring constantly. Cook
until very thick. Place the oysters in a pan and heat one minute.
This "plumps" them. Do not cook too long. Add the
oysters to the white sauce, and serve immediately in patty
shells which have been freshened in a hot oven.</p>


<div class='recipetitle'><b>Bettina's Surprise Salad</b> (Six portions)</div>

<div class='ingredients1'>
6 apples<br />
1 green pepper, chopped fine<br />
½ <abbr title="cup">C</abbr>-diced celery<br />
½ <abbr title="cup">C</abbr>-seeded white grapes<br />
½ <abbr title="cup">C</abbr>-sliced diced pineapple<br />
2 <abbr title="tablespoon">T</abbr>-chopped nut meats<br />
1 <abbr title="cup">C</abbr>-salad dressing<br />
½ <abbr title="teaspoon">t</abbr>-salt<br />
½ <abbr title="cup">C</abbr>-diced marshmallows<br />
</div><p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_253" id="Page_253">[253]</a></span></p>

<p>Remove the insides of the apples, add the green pepper,
celery, grapes, marshmallows, pineapple, nut-meats and salt,
mixed thoroughly with the salad dressing. Serve very cold.</p>


<div class='recipetitle'><b>To Make the Hallowe'en Sandwiches</b></div>

<p>When the bread is a day old, cut in slices one-third inch
thick. Match in pairs. Cream the butter and spread one side.
Place the other side on top. Press firmly. With a thimble cut
out circles on one piece of the bread, cut nose and mouth with
a knife. The butter showing through gives the resemblance
to features.</p>


<div class='recipetitle'><b>Pumpkin Pie</b> (Eight pies)</div>

<div class='recipetitle'><b>Crusts</b></div>

<div class='ingredients1'>
1 <abbr title="cup">C</abbr>-flour<br />
5 <abbr title="tablespoon">T</abbr>-lard<br />
3 <abbr title="tablespoon">T</abbr>-water<br />
½ <abbr title="teaspoon">t</abbr>-salt<br />
</div>

<p>Cut the lard into the flour and salt. Add sufficient water
to make a stiff dough on a floured board. Roll into shape one-fourth
inch thick. Place in tin muffin pans making individual
pies, filling with the following mixture and baking 30 minutes
in a moderate oven.</p>

<div class='recipetitle'><b>Pumpkin Filling</b></div>

<div class='ingredients1'>
1½ <abbr title="cup">C</abbr>-canned pumpkin<br />
<span class='small'><sup>2</sup>/<sub>3</sub></span> <abbr title="cup">C</abbr>-brown sugar<br />
1 <abbr title="teaspoon">t</abbr>-cinnamon<br />

½ <abbr title="teaspoon">t</abbr>-salt<br />
2 eggs<br />
2 <abbr title="cup">C</abbr>-milk<br />
</div>

<p>Mix the ingredients in the order given, and fill the pie-crusts
two-thirds full.</p>


<div class='recipetitle'><b>Jumbles</b> (Twenty-four jumbles)</div>

<div class='ingredients1'>
½ <abbr title="cup">C</abbr>-butter<br />
1 <abbr title="cup">C</abbr>-sugar<br />

¼ <abbr title="teaspoon">t</abbr>-salt<br />
About 2 <abbr title="cup">C</abbr>-flour<br />
Grape jelly.<br />
</div>

<p>Cream the butter, add the sugar, and gradually add the egg,
the soda mixed with the sour milk, the salt, and the flour to
make a soft dough. (One which will roll easily.) Cut into
shape with a round cooky cutter. On the centers of one-half
the pieces, place a spoonful of grape jelly. Make features on
the rest, using a thimble to cut out the eyes. Press the two
together, and bake 12 minutes in a moderate oven.</p>

called Bob at the door.
"Frost tonight all right! I was
glad I took my overcoat this
morning. Have you had a fire
all day?"</div>

<p>"Yes, indeed," said Bettina,
"and I've spent most of the afternoon
cleaning my furs with
corn meal, and fixing those new
comforters for the sleeping
porch, and putting away some of the summer clothing."</p>

<p>"I believe we will need those new comforters tonight. How
were you fixing them?"</p>

<p>"I was basting a white cheese-cloth edge, about twelve inches
wide, along the width that goes at the head of the bed, you
know. It's so easy to rip off and wash, and I like to have all
the comforters fixed that way. I was cleaning my old furs,
too, to cut them up. I'm planning to have a fur edge on my
suit this winter. I don't believe you'll know the furs, the
suit, or Bettina when you see the combination we will make together!
Fur is the thing this year, you know."</p>

<p>"Couldn't you spare me a little to transform my overcoat?
I'd like to look different, too!"</p>

<p>"Silly! Come along to the kitchen! There's beefsteak to-night

<h2>CHAPTER LXXIX</h2>

<div class='chaptertitle'>SURPRISING ALICE AND HARRY</div>


<div class='cap'>"WE knew you'd be here, and we've come to surprise
you!" shouted Bob, Fred, Bettina and Ruth, as they
opened the door of the new apartment which was to be the
home of Harry and Alice. "We've brought the party with
us!" and they held out several bulging baskets.</div>

<p>"Welcome!" smiled Alice, delightedly, as she stepped down
from the box on which she was standing to hang a soft, silky
curtain. Harry, tall and silent, rose, hammer in hand from
the crate he was opening, and welcomed each one in turn.</p>

<p>"Bob and I came to be chaperones if you needed us," said
Bettina, putting on a prim and disapproving look, as different
as possible from her usual happy expression.</p>

<p>"Oh, my dear!" exclaimed Alice's mother, in a shocked tone.
"Surely you didn't imagine&mdash;but then, of course you didn't&mdash;because
you would naturally know that I would be here."</p>

<p>Alice laughed her ringing laugh. "Mother is too literal for
any use, Bettina!" And Alice's absent-minded father looked
up from the newspaper he was reading to ask what the joke
was.</p>

<p>"The joke, Father dear," said Alice, "is that your foolish
daughter should be about to marry this solemn and serious
youth!" And she turned Harry around by the shoulders till
he faced her father. "But perhaps you hadn't heard about the
wedding, Father. Now don't tell me you had forgotten!"</p>

<p>"Forgotten? Forgotten your wedding, Alice?" said her
mother, astonished. "Of course your father hasn't forgotten.
Why, only yesterday he was saying that the cost of a trousseau<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_259" id="Page_259">[259]</a></span>
apparently hadn't lessened since Lillian was married. Weren't
you, Father? It was when your new green corduroy came
home, Alice, and I was saying&mdash;&mdash;" but Alice had led the girls
off to show them over the apartment.</p>

<p>Father had retired behind his newspaper and Harry was
showing Fred and Bob his own private den whither he might
retire from the worries of domestic life. "Only," observed
Fred sagaciously, "since it opens off the living room, you can't
retire very far. I predict that married life will make you
rather a sociable person, Harry."</p>

<p>Harry shrugged his shoulders, and said nothing. "Old
bear!" cried Alice, entering the room at this point. "You
don't need to be a sociable person! I like you just as you are!"
And she turned to the others. "Come to the party, please. It's
all in the kitchen! We've made coffee, too, and everything is
bee-youtiful! I love surprises!"</p>

<p>The "party" consisted of:</p>

of the formality of the occasion. Even Alice, usually the ringleader
in all their fun, was a little silent.</div>

<p>"Shucks!" thought boyish Fred. "None of this in mine!
I'd elope first! Wonder if Harry likes it! (Bet he doesn't.)"</p>

<p>Ruth was thinking, "Oh, how lovely! How perfectly
lovely! I believe after all&mdash;as a time to remember through
all the years&mdash;&mdash;" But Fred could not read her thoughts, and
saw only the particularly happy smile that she gave him.</p>

<p>"How do you like the nut cups?" Alice asked. "Bettina
made these yellow 'mum' nut cups as a Christmas gift to me,
and gave them to me now for this dinner! See, they just
match the real chrysanthemums! I'm sure I don't know
which I like best!"</p>

<p>The girls exclaimed so heartily over the nut cups that Bettina
declared to herself that she would make sets for each
of them, of different colors and kinds. These of Alice's were
really charming. Their wire handles were wound with green
maline and tied with a green bow. They were filled with pecans,
and pink and yellow bon-bons, which were grapes covered
with colored creams.</p>

<p>The place cards were tied with narrow green ribbon to little
china slippers, cupids, doves and hearts. Besides the yellow<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_262" id="Page_262">[262]</a></span>
chrysanthemums, which were the table decorations, there was
for each of the girls a corsage bouquet of pink roses, and for
each of the men a boutonniere of pink rosebuds in a tinfoil
case. Flower pins were tucked in the maline bows of the
bouquets as favors for the girls, while scarf pins were favors
for the men.</p>

<p>When the dinner was over, and the guests were passing into
the living room for dancing and music, Alice slipped her arm
through Bettina's. "The dinner was lovely; wasn't it?" she
said. "I did think I was too tired to enjoy it, but my heart is
as light as a feather now! I am going to dance all evening till
my last guest goes!"</p>

<p>The menu was as follows:</p>

<h2>CHAPTER LXXXI</h2>

<div class='chaptertitle'>REHEARSING THE CEREMONY</div>


<div class='cap'>ALICE'S wedding day dawned clear and cold, and Bettina
realized with a start all that was before her. She
had as house guests two school friends of Alice's, gay and
charming girls who were, nevertheless, somewhat difficult visitors,
as the little bungalow was soon strewn with their belongings
and as they were completely indifferent to such a thing as
punctuality.</div>

<p>"S'pose Geraldine'll be in to borrow my mirror in a minute,"
grumbled Bob. "How long'll they stay?"</p>

<p>"'Till tomorrow morning, dear. Hurry! You know we
have to rehearse at ten o'clock."</p>

<p>"Ushers and all?"</p>

<p>"Of course. You wouldn't know what to do without a rehearsal,
would you?"</p>

<p>"I suppose not. But what if I can't get away from the
office?"</p>

<p>"You'll have to, Bob, for Harry's sake. Surely you can
manage it for once."</p>

<p>Bob went on grumbling about the foolishness of "these
fancy weddings" until Bettina consoled him with the promise
of waffles for breakfast.</p>

<p>"And we'll simply have to call Geraldine and Lenore," said
she. "They are going to the rehearsal with me, and I must
have my morning's work done before we start. You see I
shall have them here for luncheon, and we won't be back 'till
noon."</p>

<p>Bettina, with some effort, managed to reach the church with<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_265" id="Page_265">[265]</a></span>
her guests shortly after ten o'clock. The nervous and excited
wedding party stood about in chattering groups, and when
summoned, went through their parts with many mistakes and
giggles.</p>

<p>"How can it ever seem beautiful and solemn," thought Bettina
in despair, "when we all do it so stupidly? I'm afraid we
are going to spoil the wedding!"</p>

<h2>CHAPTER LXXXII</h2>

<div class='chaptertitle'>AFTER THE WEDDING</div>


<div class='cap'>THE stately wedding ceremony had taken place in the big
church, and Bettina, climbing into the automobile for
the drive to the reception, had, for all her own part in the
affair, only a confused memory of music, lights and faces, soft
lavender and soft pink, and Alice and Harry murmuring their
vows.</div>

<p>"Wasn't it lovely, Bob? Wasn't it stately and impressive?"</p>

<p>"Say, aren't you cold?" was his prosy reply. "That church
was too warm; take my coat!"</p>

<p>"No, indeed; I don't need it! Oh, wasn't it a beautiful
wedding! Did Lillian and I walk slowly enough?" And she
chattered on about all of the details until the house was
reached.</p>

<p>The bride and groom were already there, and gay congratulations
followed from the many guests. The dining-room,
where the dainty wedding supper was served, was elaborate
with palms and high baskets of roses. Tables about the
room held six, and in the center, a large round table, decorated
with a broad, low mound of violets and roses, was arranged
for the bridal party. Here also was the bride's cake,
and the small boxes of wedding cake which the guests received
upon leaving the room.</p>

<p>When Alice cut the bride's cake, the thimble fell to Ruth,
which occasioned much merriment, while the dime was discovered
by Harry in his own piece. The ring went to Mary,
who emphatically denied that the omen spoke truly. But<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_268" id="Page_268">[268]</a></span>
when Mary also caught Alice's bouquet of lilies-of-the-valley,
the young people refused to listen to her protests.</p>

<p>"Dear Alice," said Bettina, as she helped the bride into her
traveling suit, "may your whole life be as beautiful as your
wedding!"</p>

<p>The wedding supper consisted of:</p>

<div class='recipetitle'><b>Chicken and Mushroom Filling for Patty Shells</b> (Fifteen portions)</div>

<div class='ingredients1'>
2 <abbr title="cup">C</abbr>-cooked chicken, diced<br />
1 <abbr title="cup">C</abbr>-button mushrooms, diced<br />
3 <abbr title="tablespoon">T</abbr>-pimentoes, cut fine<br />

<span class='small'><sup>2</sup>/<sub>3</sub></span> <abbr title="cup">C</abbr>-chicken fat<br />
3 <abbr title="cup">C</abbr>-milk<br />
</div>

<p>Melt the fat, add the flour and salt; mix thoroughly. Add
one-half a cup of milk. Cook until thick, remove from the
fire and heat one minute. Add one cup of milk and reheat.
When it thickens, beat vigorously until creamy. Add the rest
of the milk, and cook until thicker than vegetable white sauce.
Add the chicken, mushrooms and pimentoes. Serve hot in
patty cases.</p>

<p>To prepare the cases for serving, heat until hot in a moderate
oven.</p>

<p>To obtain the chicken fat, cook a fat chicken slowly for a
long time. Remove the chicken from the stock and allow the
stock to cool. The fat will rise to the top. Use this instead of
butter. It has a better flavor and is cheaper.</p>


<div class='recipetitle'><b>Fruit Jelly</b> (Fifteen portions)</div>

<p>Soak the gelatin twenty minutes in the cold water, and dissolve
in the boiling water, stirring till all is thoroughly dissolved.
Strain through a moistened cheese-cloth and add the
sugar and the lemon juice. Place in moistened individual
moulds or one large pan. When the mixture is slightly thick
and cool, add the fruit, well-mixed. Set in a cold place for one
hour. Cut in squares when desired for use.</p><hr class="chap" /><p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_270" id="Page_270">[270]</a></span></p>

<div class='chaptertitle'>A "HAPPEN-IN" LUNCHEON</div>


<div class='cap'>BETTINA had finished her morning's work and was busy
with her mending when the telephone rang.</div>

<p>"Why, hello, Bob!" she answered, surprised to hear his
voice at this time of day.</p>

<p>"Bettina," said he, "could you possibly arrange to let me
bring Carl Edwards and his wife home to luncheon? They
blew in a few minutes ago and leave at two-thirty. We haven't
much time, you see, and they are especially anxious to see the
house. They are planning to build for themselves soon."</p>

<p>"Why, of course, Bob," said Bettina, hesitating for the briefest
possible second. "It's after eleven now, but I'll be glad to
have you bring them. Let's see&mdash;I'll give them the salad I
had planned for tonight, but I don't know what else&mdash;but, then,
I'll manage somehow."</p>

<p>"All right, dear; that's fine. We'll be there early&mdash;a little
after twelve."</p>

<p>Bettina's "emergency shelf" was always well stocked, and
before her conversation with Bob was over her mind had
hastily reviewed its contents. In a very short time, her oven
held escalloped salmon, graham gems and "quick pudding,"
and she was setting the dainty porch table. "I'm glad the
weather is so beautiful," she said to herself, "for it is so much
fun to have a hurry-up luncheon like this out-of-doors. Well,
whatever the guests think, I'm sure that Bob will like my
menu, for 'quick pudding' is a favorite dessert of his, and
he can always eat several graham gems!"</p>

John, letting in a gust of snow-filled air as he opened
the front door.</div>

<p>"Why, Uncle John, I should say you are!" answered Bettina
with delight as she removed her kitchen apron. "Do you
smell my date buns? I believe you'll like them!"</p>

<p>"Date buns? Never heard of anything so absurd in my
whole life! What are they?" And then, without waiting for
an answer, he went on, "A regular blizzard tonight, I do believe!
I telephoned your Aunt Lucy that I wouldn't be back
to the farm till morning, then I found a place to leave my car,
and came up here to see if I couldn't get a bite to eat. But
date buns! I don't know about that! I'm not used to anything
so fancy."</p>

<p>"Well, Uncle John, there's a salmon loaf baking in the oven,
and also some lemon rice pudding, so I believe there'll be
something you'll like."</p>

<p>"Maybe!" said Uncle John, doubtfully, but with a twinkle
in his eye that belied his words. "But let me see! Aunt Lucy
sent you something; what was it? Oh, yes, some cream!"
And he took a glass jar from its wrappings.</p>

<p>"Oh, Uncle John, how lovely!" said Bettina. "Won't we
just revel in cream! There comes Bob now! Get behind the
door, Uncle John, and say 'boo'! the way you used to do with
me when I was a little girl!"</p>

<h2>CHAPTER LXXXV</h2>

<div class='chaptertitle'>DURING THE TEACHERS' CONVENTION</div>


<div class='cap'>"SO you'll not be back until dinner time?" Bettina had
said at the breakfast table to Bob's cousin, Edna, and
her friend, Catherine. "A whole day of it! How tired you'll
be!"</div>

<p>Edna laughed her ripply laugh that always made everyone
else laugh, too. "Tired getting me a hat and a suit? Oh, Bettina!
That makes me feel livelier than ever!"</p>

<p>Catherine looked troubled. "Now, Edna," she said, "you
positively mustn't miss that afternoon meeting. I know it will
be so inspiring! Remember what Professor Macy said!"</p>

<p>Edna laughed again. "Catherine always quotes Professor
Macy as if he were an oracle or a sphinx or something instead
of a nice solemn young high school teacher who's getting a
little bald!"</p>

<p>"He isn't bald and he isn't solemn," declared Catherine with
some spirit.</p>

<p>"Forgive me, Catherine dear! He is a lamb and a darling
and everything else you want me to say!"</p>

<p>"I want you to say? Why, Edna, aren't you ashamed!"
said Catherine, growing very red. "Who ever heard of such
nonsense?"</p>

<p>"I love to tease you, Catherine. It's so easy! So you won't
help me get my hat? I want a beautiful purple one&mdash;or else
a perky little black one. I haven't decided whether to be
stately and gracious, or frivolous and cunning. But I do know
that I will not look as if I were about to cram the multiplication
table into the head of some poor little innocent!"</p><p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_276" id="Page_276">[276]</a></span></p>

<p>"Don't worry, Edna," said Bob. "You won't look that way
at all. In fact, I wonder that you can be serious long enough
to impress the members of the school board when they come
visiting."</p>

<p>"She doesn't try to impress them; she just smiles at them
instead, and that does just as well," said Catherine. "But
she's not so utterly frivolous as her conversation sounds. She
wants to hear the convention addresses just as much as I do&mdash;and
I know she'll be there this afternoon. In fact, I intend
to save a seat for her."</p>

<p>"Between you and Professor Macy?" asked Edna, innocently.
"Or on his left?"</p>

<p>"Shame on you, Edna," said Bettina. "Now you girls tell
me just what you'd like for dinner! Aren't there some special
dishes you're hungry for?"</p>

<p>"Pork tenderloin and sweet potatoes!" said Edna. "Our
landlady never has them, and I often dream of the joy of ordering
such delicacies!"</p>

<p>And so that evening for dinner Bettina had:</p>

<div class='chaptertitle'>A LUNCHEON FOR THE TEACHERS</div>


<div class='cap'>"I'LL stay at home and help you this morning; may I, Bettina?"
asked Edna, looking wistfully around at Bettina's
white kitchen.</div>

<p>"No, indeed, my dear. It is such a simple little luncheon
that I have planned that I can easily do it all alone. And you
must go to the meeting. All I ask is that you won't forget to
come home at noon."</p>

<p>"Edna would much rather fuss around with you in this
dear little kitchen than to go to the meetings," said Catherine,
"but I won't let her. She is always crazy to cook and do housework
and things like that, but she came to this convention with
me, and I intend to have her get the benefit of it. Do you
hear me, you bad girl? It's almost time for us to be there.
Go and get your things!"</p>

<p>"This is the way I'm managed all the time!" complained
Edna to Bettina. "Do you wonder that I look thin and pale?"</p>

<p>"Poor Edna!" said Bettina, smiling at her round figure and
rosy cheeks. "Now do run along with Catherine. But don't
forget we'll have three other guests at noon! So wear your

Gradually add the milk, cook until thick and creamy (about
three minutes), and add the oysters. Serve very hot on toast.
Garnish with parsley.</p>


<div class='recipetitle'><b>Pear Salad</b> (Six portions)</div>

<div class='ingredients1'>
6 halves of pear<br />
½ <abbr title="cup">C</abbr>-cottage cheese<br />
1 <abbr title="tablespoon">T</abbr>-chopped pimento<br />

mixture and lay one nut meat on top of each portion. Serve
cold.</p>


<div class='recipetitle'><b>Pecan Ice Cream</b> (Ten portions)</div>

<p>Mix the cream, sugar and vanilla. Fill a freezer half full of

beaten. Remove the egg beater and cut and fold the flour
which has been sifted four times, the salt having been added
to the last sifting. Bake one hour in an unbuttered, narrow
pan in a slow oven.</p>

<p>Genuine sponge cake has no baking powder or soda in it.
The eggs must be vigorously beaten so that the cake will rise.
A very slow oven is necessary. Increase the heat slightly every
fifteen minutes.</p>

<p>Do not cut sponge cake; it should be broken apart with a

<h2>CHAPTER LXXXVII</h2>

<div class='chaptertitle'>RUTH COMES TO LUNCHEON</div>


<div class='cap'>"BETTINA, what makes the gas stove pop like that when
I light it? I've often wondered."</div>

<p>"Why, Ruth, that's because you apply the match too soon.
You ought to allow the gas to flow for about four seconds;
that fills all the little holes with gas and blows out the air.
Then light it, and it won't pop or go out. The flame ought to
burn blue; if it burns yellow, turn it off, and adjust it again."</p>

<p>"Well, I'm glad to know that. Sometimes it has been all
right and sometimes it hasn't, and I never realized that it was
because I applied the match too soon. I'm glad I came today."</p>

<p>"I'm glad, too, but not because of instructing you, I'm not
competent to do that in very many things, goodness knows!
When I called up and asked you to lunch, it was because I had
such a longing to see what lovely things you'd be making
today. You will have the daintiest, prettiest trousseau, Ruth!"</p>

<p>"I love to embroider, so I'm getting great fun out of it. I
tell Fred it's a treat to make pretty things and keep them all!
They were usually for gifts before! Oh, lobster salad?"</p>

<p>"No, creamed lobster on toast. There, Mister Lobster,
you're out of your can. I always hurry him out in double-quick
time onto a plate, or into an earthen-ware dish, because
I'm so afraid something might interrupt me, and I'd be careless
enough to leave him in the opened can! Though I know I
never could be so careless. Then I never leave a metal fork
standing in lobster or canned fish. It's a bad thing."</p>

<p>"I knew about the can, but not about the fork, though I don't
believe I ever do leave a fork or a spoon in anything like
that."</p><p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_282" id="Page_282">[282]</a></span></p>

<p>"Would you prefer tea, coffee, or chocolate with these cookies
for dessert?"</p>

<p>"Coffee, I believe, Bettina. Aren't they cunning cookies!
What are they?"</p>

<p>"Peanut cookies. I think they are good, and they are so
simple to make. They are nice with afternoon tea; mother
often serves them. There&mdash;lunch is all ready but the coffee,

<h2>CHAPTER LXXXIX</h2>

<div class='chaptertitle'>SOME CHRISTMAS PLANS</div>


<div class='cap'>"CHRISTMAS is in the air today, I believe," said Charlotte
as she took off her hat and warmed her cold
hands at Bettina's open fire. "You ought to see the children
around the toys downtown&mdash;swarming like flies at the molasses!
Still, we ought to think about Thanksgiving before we
begin our Christmas plans, I suppose."</div>

<p>"I try to get all my Christmas packages ready by Thanksgiving,"
said Bettina. "Of course, I don't always succeed,
but it is a splendid aim to have! There is always so much to
do at the last minute&mdash;baking and company and candy making!
This year we plan to give very few gifts&mdash;but to send
a card at least to each of our friends. We're racking our
brains now to think of something that will be individual&mdash;really
ours, you know. I think a tiny snapshot of yourself or
your home, or your baby or your dog&mdash;or even a sprig of holly
or a bit of evergreen on a card with a few written words of
greeting means more to a friend than all the lovely engraved
cards in the world! Of course, some people can draw or paint
and make their own&mdash;Alice will, I'm sure. One girl I know
makes wonderful fruit cake, and she always sends a piece of
it, in a little box tied with holly ribbon, to each of her friends.
Aren't the little gifts that aren't too hard on one's purse the
best after all&mdash;especially when they really come straight from
the giver, and not merely from the store?"</p>

up the hose she had been darning. "Good!" said Bettina.
"The dinner is just ready for them, and I'm glad they
didn't keep us waiting."</div>

<p>"Hello! Hello!" shouted Frank and Bob, letting in a gust of
cold air as they opened the door. "Whew! It's cold!"</p>

<p>"How was the game?"</p>

<p>"Fine! 39 to 0 in favor of Blake!"</p>

<p>"Not very exciting, I should think."</p>

<p>"Still, Frank here wanted to bet me that Blake would be
badly beaten!"</p>

<p>"Frank!" said Charlotte in exasperation. "Is that the way
you show your loyalty to your home college?"</p>

<p>"Shame on you, Frank!" grinned Bob. "Well, dinner
ready? I'm about starving!"</p>

<p>"Bettina has a regular 'after-the-game' dinner tonight," said
Charlotte. "Just the kind to make a man's heart rejoice!"</p>

<p>"Hurray!" said Bob, stirring up the grate fire. "And afterward
we'll have our coffee in here, and toast marshmallows.
Shall we?"</p>

<p>"Suits me!" said Frank. "Anything you suggest suits me,
if it's something to eat."</p>

<p>"Dinner's ready," said Bettina. "Come into the dining-room,

<p>Cut with a knife across the grain of the flank steak, to prevent
it from curling up. Sprinkle the flour and one teaspoonful
of salt on both sides of the meat. Dot with butter, and place
in an oblong baking pan. Over the meat place a thick layer
of sliced raw potatoes. Add the green pepper, and season
with one-half a teaspoonful of salt. Place the onions next and
the rest of the salt. (One-half a teaspoonful.) Pour one
cup of stewed or raw tomato pulp over all the mixture, and
cover the baking pan tightly. Cook slowly in the oven for
two hours. One-half hour before the meat is done, remove
the cover to allow it to brown. Water may need to be added
to prevent burning. In serving, very carefully transfer the
steak to a hot platter, preserving the various layers of vegetables.
To serve, slice down through the layers as through a

<h2>CHAPTER XCI</h2>

<div class='chaptertitle'>A THANKSGIVING DINNER IN THE COUNTRY</div>


<div class='cap'>AFTER all the excitement of Alice's wedding, Bettina
was more than delighted when she and Bob were invited
to a family dinner at Aunt Lucy's on Thanksgiving day. "It
always seems to me the most comfortable and restful place in
the world," said she to Bob. "And Aunt Lucy is such a wonderful
cook, too! We're very lucky this year, I can tell you!"</div>

<p>"Who's to be there?"</p>

<p>"Father and mother&mdash;we are to drive out with them&mdash;and
Aunt Lucy's sister and her big family. Thanksgiving seems
more natural with children at the table, I think. And those
are the liveliest, rosiest children!"</p>

<p>Bob had slept late that morning, and consequently had eaten
no breakfast, but he did not regret his keen appetite when
Uncle John was carving the great brown turkey.</p>

<p>"The children first, John," said kind Aunt Lucy. "The
grown folks can wait."</p>

<p>Little Dick and Sarah had exclaimed with delight at the
place cards of proud turkeys standing beside each plate. In
the center of the table was a great wicker basket heaped with
oranges, nuts and raisins.</p>

<p>"It doesn't seem natural without pumpkin pie," said Aunt
Lucy, "but John was all for plum pudding instead."</p>

<p>"We can have pie any day," said Uncle John, "but this is a
special occasion. What with Dick here&mdash;and Sarah&mdash;and Bettina&mdash;who's
some cook herself, I can tell you!&mdash;I was determined
that mother should show her skill! And she did; didn't
she?"</p><p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_293" id="Page_293">[293]</a></span></p>

<div class='recipetitle'><b>Roast Turkey</b> (Fourteen portions)</div>

<div class='ingredients1'>
1 12-<abbr title="pound">lb.</abbr> turkey<br />
</div>

<p>The turkey should be thoroughly cleaned and washed in a
pan of water to which one teaspoon of soda has been added
to each two quarts of water. Wash the inside with a cloth,
rinsing thoroughly, allowing plenty of water to run through the
turkey. Dry well and stuff. Season all over with salt, pepper
and butter. When baking, lay the fowl first on one side, then
on the other until one-half hour before taking from the oven.
Then it should be turned on its back, allowing the breast to
brown. A twelve pound turkey should be cooked three hours
in a moderate oven, basting frequently.</p>


<div class='recipetitle'><b>Oyster Dressing</b> (Fourteen portions)</div>

<div class='ingredients1'>
6 <abbr title="cup">C</abbr>-stale bread crumbs<br />

1 pt. oysters<br />
</div>

<p>Mix the ingredients in the order given, adding the oysters
cleaned and drained from the liquor. Fill the turkey and sew
up with needle and thread.</p>


<div class='recipetitle'><b>Preparing the Giblets</b></div>

<p>Wash thoroughly the heart, liver and gizzard. Cut through
the thick muscle of the gizzard and peel it slowly without
breaking through the inside lining. Cut the heart open, and
remove carefully the gall bladder from the liver. Wash carefully
again, and soak ten minutes in salted water. Cook slowly<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_294" id="Page_294">[294]</a></span>
until tender, in one cup of water. More water may be needed.
Cut fine, and add to the gravy. Save the stock.</p>

</div>

<p>For each cup of liquor, which is left in the roasting pan, add
one tablespoon of flour. Mix the flour with two tablespoons of
cold water, add the liquid slowly, and cook two minutes. Add
one-fourth of a teaspoon of salt, and the giblets. Serve hot.</p>

½ <abbr title="cup">C</abbr>-currants<br />
½ <abbr title="cup">C</abbr>-raisins<br />
1 <abbr title="teaspoon">t</abbr>-vanilla<br />
</div>

<p>Chop the suet, and sprinkle with one tablespoon of flour to
prevent sticking. Add the raisins, currants, "C" sugar, salt,
cinnamon, cloves and bread crumbs. Add the egg and milk
beaten together, add the vanilla, mix the soda in the molasses
and add to the first mixture. Fill a well-buttered pudding

<h2>CHAPTER XCII</h2>

<div class='chaptertitle'>PLANNING THE CHRISTMAS CARDS</div>


<div class='cap'>"AND what is in this dish, Bettina?" asked Bob, as he
lifted the hot cover.</div>

<p>"Candied sweet potatoes, dear, and I'm almost sure that
you'll like them. I made them in the fireless cooker, and
they're really more candy than potatoes."</p>

<p>"They'll suit me, then," said Bob. "The sweeter the better!
My mother used to cook up candied sweet potatoes with a lot
of brown sugar syrup&mdash;say, but they tasted good about this
time of year when I would come in from skating! Well, I
believe these are exactly like hers!"</p>

<p>"Only hers weren't made in a fireless cooker," said Bettina.
"Now, Bob, as soon as you have allayed your hunger a little
we must put our heads together long enough to get an idea for
Christmas cards. If we have something made, it may take
several weeks, and you know it is no small task to address
several hundred of them. As soon as we have ordered them,
we'd better make out our Christmas list. But first, what shall
the cards be? Think, Bob!"</p>

<p>"Goodness gracious sakes alive, but thinking is hot work!
Well, how's this? Suppose we don't have cards engraved&mdash;they're
expensive, and besides, 'twould take too long! We'll
find some plain white correspondence cards&mdash;or perhaps white
cards with a red edge&mdash;and envelopes to go with them, and in
the corner of the card we'll stick a tiny round snapshot of the
house. Then we'll write this verse very neatly and sign it
'Bettina and Bob.' Perhaps you can improve on this, however:</p><p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_296" id="Page_296">[296]</a></span></p>

<h2>CHAPTER XCIV</h2>

<div class='chaptertitle'>THE FIRELIGHT SOCIAL</div>


<div class='cap'>"AND what have you been doing all day?" asked Bob
after he had related his own experiences at the office.
"Just my usual work this morning, and this afternoon I
went to a meeting of the social committee of our Young
People's League; you know I've promised to help this winter.
They plan a social to be given in about two weeks to raise
money for the orphanage fund, and I do think their idea is a
clever one. You see, it's a 'firelight social'; admission ten
cents. Mrs. Lewis has offered her house for it. Invitations
are to be sent to all members of the church, Sunday school
and league, inviting people to 'come and read pictures in the
fire.' The cards are to be decorated with little pen and ink
sketches of hearthstones with burning logs on them. Of
course there will be a huge log in her big fireplace. Then as
soon as the guests are gathered around, someone is to read
aloud that passage from 'Our Mutual Friend,' where Lizzie
Hexam reads the pictures in the firelight for her brother. Then
pencils and paper will be passed among the guests and each one
writes a short description of the pictures he sees in the fire.
In ten minutes these are collected and read aloud, with a prize
for the best one. Then corn will be popped and marshmallows
toasted, and weird ghost stories told. (Of course certain
clever people have been asked beforehand to be prepared.)
Then supper will be served by candlelight; it will consist of
things like sandwiches, cider, coffee, nuts and cookies. Don't
you think a firelight social will be fun?"</div>

<p>"Sure it will! But I'm glad to-night we can be alone by
our own firelight, Bettina!"</p><p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_303" id="Page_303">[303]</a></span></p>

<h2>CHAPTER XCV</h2>

<div class='chaptertitle'>ALICE'S TROUBLES</div>


<div class='cap'>"WHY, Alice, come in! Are you going out to dinner, or
just on your way home from some afternoon party?"</div>

<p>"I'm going down town to dinner with Harry; I'll meet him
there. And afterward we are going to the theatre."</p>

<p>"What fun!"</p>

<p>"Yes, fun for me," said Alice slowly. "I persuaded him to
go. Just think, Bettina, we haven't been to the theatre one
single time since we've been married!"</p>

<p>"And that is&mdash;let's see&mdash;about six weeks?" said Bettina,
laughing. "Come into the kitchen, Alice. I'm making a cranberry
pie for dinner."</p>

<p>"A cranberry pie? One of those darling criss-crossy ones?"
said Alice joyfully, throwing off her evening cloak. "Do let
me help. I used to make little cranberry pies in a saucer when
I was little! I had forgotten that they existed! Harry shall
have one to-morrow!" And she rolled out the crust with
deft fingers.</p>

<p>"How easily and quickly you do everything, Alice."</p>

<p>"Yes, too easily. Getting breakfast is fun, and getting dinner
is fun, but it's over too soon. What do you do in the evening,
Bettina?"</p>

<p>"Oh, stay at home and read and mend mostly. What do
you do?"</p>

<p>"That's the trouble. Don't you get dreadfully bored just
sitting around? Harry likes it&mdash;but I don't see how he can."</p>

<p>"But aren't you tired in the evening? I suppose he is."</p>

<p>"Tired? Mercy no! Not with the care of that little apartment!
I like fun and excitement and something to do in the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_306" id="Page_306">[306]</a></span>
evening! I've been studying household economy, as you suggested,
and I've learned a lot, but I can't be doing that all the

<p>Add the onion, green peppers, parsley, salt and celery salt to
the crumbs. Add the egg-yolk, butter and water, and mix
thoroughly. Wipe the chops, and place one in a small pan (to
serve as a roasting pan), place the dressing on top. Place
the other chop on top of the dressing. Press together and
bake in a moderate oven one hour. Turn the chops so that
the under one will brown. Baste occasionally with one-fourth
of a cup of hot water to which has been added one teaspoon
of butter. Put a lid on the pan so that the steam will cause
the chops to cook. Place one tablespoon of water in the pan
to prevent burning or drying out. Replenish when necessary.</p>

shape, and reserve a small part of the dough for the bars. Fit
the crust carefully into a deep tin pie-pan. Fill the crust with

what I've been making?"</div>

curious to know what particular thing it is that makes this
ham so tender. Is it baked? Anyhow, it's the best I have
ever eaten."</p>

<p>"Thank you," said Bettina, "but you always say that about
sliced ham, no matter how it is cooked. But this is a little
different. It is baked in milk."</p>

<p>"Great, anyhow," said Bob. "Now tell me about your conspiracy
with Santa Claus."</p>

tried and true."</p>

<p>"I shall have you think what to say on all the gifts, Bob. I

will like her new cook book. Then for Mary and Eleanor I<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_309" id="Page_309">[309]</a></span>
have made card-table covers. Mary's is of white Indian head&mdash;just
a square of it, bound with white tape and with white
tape at the corners for tying it to the table. It is to have a
white monogram. Eleanor's is linen-colored and is bound in
green with a green monogram. Hers is finished and I shall
finish Mary's this evening&mdash;that is, if you will read to me while

<p>"Did the Christmas spirit inspire this plum pudding?" said
he. "Blessings on the head of Santa Claus! But why your

<p>"Because today I went shopping in earnest! I bought the
very things that seem most Christmassy: tissue paper, white
and green, gold cord, a ball of red twine, Santa Claus and
holly stickers, and the cards to tie to the packages. I love to
wrap up Christmas things!"</p>

<p>"And are most of your gifts ready to be wrapped?"</p>

<p>"No, not all, for some of them can't be made till the last
minute. For instance, I thought and thought about Uncle
Eric's gift! I want so much to please him, but he has everything
that money can buy except perhaps a cook that suits
him. Finally I decided to send him a box containing a jar of
spiced peaches, a jar of Russian dressing, a little round fruit
cake, and a box of fudge. The things will all be wrapped

<div class='cap'>"SPEAKING of Christmas gifts," said Charlotte, "wouldn't
anyone be delighted to receive a little jar of your Russian
dressing, Bettina?"</div>

<p>"I'm sure I'd like it!" said Frank Dixon. "Much better than
a pink necktie or a white gift book called 'Thoughts at Christmas-Tide!'"</p>

<p>"Mary Owen makes candied orange peel for all of her
friends," said Bettina, "and I think that is so nice, for hers
is delicious! She saves candy boxes through the year, and all
of her close friends receive the same gift with Mary's card.
We all know what to expect from her, and we are all delighted,
too. And you see she doesn't have to worry over different
gifts for each one. I do think Christmas is growing more
sensible, don't you?"</p>

<p>"My sister in South Carolina sends out her Christmas gifts
a few weeks early," said Frank. "She sends boxes of mistletoe
to everyone. They seem to be welcome, too. By the way,
Bob, did you and Bettina decide on your Christmas cards?"</p>

<p>"Yes," said Bob, "and they are partly ready. But we are
waiting to get a little picture of the bungalow with snow on
the roof&mdash;a winter picture seems most appropriate&mdash;and the
snow isn't forthcoming! The weather man seems to be all
upset this year."</p>

<p>"Charlotte has been making some small calendars to send
out," said Frank. "She has used her kodak pictures, and I'm<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_314" id="Page_314">[314]</a></span>
afraid they're mostly of me! I don't know what some of my

<h2>CHAPTER XCIX</h2>

<div class='chaptertitle'>A CHRISTMAS SHOWER</div>


<div class='cap'>"DEAR Bettina," wrote Polly, "somehow I never do like
to write letters&mdash;certainly not at this busiest time of
the year!&mdash;but I simply must tell you about a luncheon that
Elizabeth Carter and I gave the other day for one of our
holiday brides. (Angeline Carey; do you remember her? A
dear girl&mdash;rather quiet, but with plenty of good common
sense.)</div>

<p>"We had a large Christmas table (aren't they simple and
effective?), with a Christmas tree in the center, strung with
tiny electric lights, and hung with tinsel and ornaments.
Strings of red Christmas bells stretched from the chandelier
above the table to the four corners. The favors at each place
were several kinds,&mdash;Santas, little Christmas trees, snow men
and sleds, all of them concealing at their bases the boxes holding
the salted nuts. The place-cards were simply Christmas
cards.</p>

<p>"Before the guest of honor stood a small Santa, larger,
however, than any of the other Santas, and in his hands were
the ends of twenty or more narrow green ribbons, each leading
to a separate shower-package at the base of the tree. These
packages (it was a miscellaneous shower) made an interesting-looking
heap, but we didn't ask Angeline to open them
until we had reached the salad course. Then she drew each
one toward her by the end of a ribbon, opened it, and read
the verse on the gift. You have no idea how clever some of<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_317" id="Page_317">[317]</a></span>
the gifts and verses were! Margaret McLaughlin&mdash;do you
remember her?&mdash;had dressed a dishmop in two tea towels,
making the funniest old woman! This she introduced as
Bridget, Angeline's cook-to-be! One of the girls who sketches
cleverly had illustrated her card with pictures of Angeline in
her kitchen.</p>

<p>"But I am forgetting our table decorations! We had furnished
four rooms for Angeline, doll size, and the furniture
of each was grouped along the table. Besides the living room,
bedroom, dining room and kitchen, we presented Angeline and
Dean with an auto (in miniature, of course), a cow, a horse,
several ducks and chickens, a ferocious dog and a sleepy cat.
Weren't we good to them? And lo and behold! beside the
auto stood Dean himself, disguised as a little china kewpie
man; while Angeline, always a lady, stood gracefully in the
living room and refused to help him with his menial tasks,
or to assist Nora, who was hanging out the clothes in the back
yard. Angeline was a kewpie, dressed in style.</p>

<p>"We had the greatest fun finding and arranging these decorations!
And now I must tell you about the luncheon itself.
I'm even enclosing our recipes, for I know you'll be interested...."</p>

<p>"Hello, there, Bettina!" called Bob at this moment, coming
in with a rush, "is dinner ready? What do you suppose I've
done? I've absolutely forgotten to send a Christmas gift to
Aunt Elizabeth, and I know she'll feel hurt. Will you go
with me after dinner to get it?"</p>

<p>Polly's luncheon menu was as follows:</p>

<div class='bettina'>A CHRISTMAS SHOWER</div>

<div class='menu'>
Grapefruit with Maraschino Cherries<br />
Chicken Croquettes&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;  Candied Sweet Potatoes<br />
Creamed Peas<br />
Light Rolls&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; Butter<br />
Cranberry Jelly<br />
Vegetable Salad&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;  Salad Dressing<br />
Santa Claus Sandwiches<br />
Chocolate Ice Cream a la Tannenbaum<br />
Christmas White Cake<br />
Salted Nuts&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;  Coffee&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;  Candy Canes<br />
</div><p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_318" id="Page_318">[318]</a></span></p>

<p>"I wish, Bettina," Polly's letter continued, "that you might
have seen the cunning sandwiches that we served with the
salad. They were cut with a star-shaped cooky cutter, and
on each one was perched a tiny Santa Claus. The sandwiches
were arranged on a tray decorated with Christmas tree
branches.</p>

<p>"And now comes the dessert. The chocolate ice cream was
served in small flower pots lined with waxed paper, and in
each flower pot grew a miniature Christmas tree. Around the
base of the tree, whipped cream was heaped to represent snow.
They were really very cunning.</p>

<p>"Served with the ice cream was a large round white cake
decorated very elaborately with icing bells and holly. On the
top was placed a real candy bell, large and red. This cake
was carried in to Angeline to cut. Around the base, inside
the cake, were twenty tiny favors wrapped in waxed paper.
They were of all sorts: pipes, canoes, flat irons, animals, birds,
many things, but all very tiny. Narrow white bows tied on
each favor indicated its position in the cake so that the pieces
could be cut to give each guest a favor. Angeline cut her
piece first and drew her favor by pulling the little white ribbon.
It was really great fun drawing and unwrapping the
favors, and the girls tried to interpret the meaning of each.
Mary Katherine, Angeline's younger sister, drew the ring, and
delightedly proclaimed that she would be the next bride. At
this the girls looked a little doubtful, for at the table were no
less than six engaged girls besides Angeline. Mary Katherine
may fool them&mdash;who knows?&mdash;but I hope not, for she is far
too young and silly to 'settle down' for many years.</p>

<p>"With the coffee we served striped candy canes.</p>

<p>"Well, Betty, I believe I've told you everything about our
Christmas luncheon. Do write me soon again, for I love to
get your letters. Stir Bob up to write occasionally; he has
forgotten his sister&mdash;now that he has a wife.</p>

<div class='level'>(All measurements are level)</div>


<div class='recipetitle'><b>Chicken Croquettes</b> (Twenty-five croquettes)</div>

<div class='ingredients1'>
A 3-<abbr title="pound">lb.</abbr> chicken, cooked and cut fine<br />
1 <abbr title="pound">lb.</abbr> lean veal, cooked and cut fine<br />
4 <abbr title="tablespoon">T</abbr>-chopped green pepper<br />
½ <abbr title="teaspoon">t</abbr>-paprika<br />
2 <abbr title="teaspoon">t</abbr>-salt<br />
1 <abbr title="cup">C</abbr>-chicken fat<br />

2 eggs<br />
3 <abbr title="tablespoon">T</abbr>-water<br />
3 <abbr title="cup">C</abbr>-cracker crumbs<br />
</div>

<p>Melt the chicken fat. Add the flour and salt and mix well.
Gradually add the milk, stirring constantly. When the mixture
gets thick and creamy, allow it to cook, with an asbestos
mat under the pan, for five minutes. This cooks the flour
thoroughly. Beat one minute to make it creamy. Add the
chicken, veal, green pepper, paprika and salt. Allow the mixture
to cool. Take one tablespoon of the cooled mixture, and
dip in the beaten egg to which the water has been added. Dip
in the crumbs and shape any desired shape, preferably conical.
Allow the croquettes to stand at least one hour before frying.
Fry in deep fat and drain on brown paper. Keep hot in the
oven until serving.</p>


<div class='recipetitle'><b>Vegetable Salad</b> (Twenty portions)</div>

<div class='ingredients1'>
10 tomatoes<br />
2 <abbr title="teaspoon">t</abbr>-salt<br />

½ <abbr title="cup">C</abbr>-oil from the canned pimento<br />
½ <abbr title="cup">C</abbr>-whipped cream<br />
</div>

<p>Arrange the lettuce leaves (washed) on salad plates. Place
one slice of tomato, two slices of pimento and two slices of
green pepper on each. Sprinkle the vegetables with pepper
and salt. Add two teaspoons of cottage cheese. Place one
teaspoon of salad dressing on each portion.</p>

<p>To prepare the salad dressing, mix boiled dressing and
pimento oil together and then add the whipped cream. Mix
well, and pile attractively on the salad.</p><hr class="chap" /><p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_320" id="Page_320">[320]</a></span></p>




<h2>CHAPTER C</h2>

<div class='chaptertitle'>BETTINA GIVES A DINNER</div>


<div class='cap'>"THE Christmas feeling is everywhere now!" said Bettina,
as she arranged a small artificial fir tree in the center
of the table. "It may be a little early, but I can't keep from
using Christmas decorations to-night. Tannenbaum, O Tannenbaum,
you look wonderfully festive with snow at your foot
and your branches strung with tinsel and ornaments! All that
you lack is candles, but I shall use my red shaded candles on
the table instead. Let me see, everything is ready, even to
the biscuits which are in the ice box waiting to be popped in
the oven when the guests arrive. The salad is mixed and
waiting, and that Washington pie does look delicious! I'm
glad I made it, for Bob is so fond of it. Wonder why Bob
doesn't come! I want him to see the table and the tree before
the others get here! And build up the fire in the fireplace.
It's snowing hard outside, and I want it to be warm and cozy
inside. There's someone! Well, off goes my apron!"</div>

<p>The "someone" proved to be Bob, who came in, very pink
as to his face, and very white as to his snow-covered shoulders.</p>

<p>"It's growing colder every minute!" said Bob. "Well, a
Christmas table! I like that! Makes a fellow feel festive!"</p>

<p>"I couldn't resist the spirit of Christmas," said Bettina.</p>

<p>"I couldn't, either," said Bob, taking a half-dozen gorgeous
yellow chrysanthemums from their wrappings. "So I bought
you an early Christmas gift. Like 'em?"</p>

<h2>CHAPTER CI</h2>

<div class='chaptertitle'>BOB'S CHRISTMAS GIFT TO BETTINA</div>


<div class='cap'>BOB had walked home from the office through the falling
snow&mdash;and it was no short distance&mdash;with thought for
neither snow nor distance. He was distinctly worried,&mdash;Christmas
only two weeks off, the first Christmas since he and Bettina
had been married, and as yet he had no idea what sort of a
Christmas gift he ought to purchase for his wife. What did
she need? Unfortunately he had heard her say only a few
days ago that she didn't need a thing. What did she secretly
long for? A glass baking dish! Shucks, what an unromantic
present! Surely Bettina had been teasing him when she mentioned
such a prosy gift as that! Well, if he didn't have some
inspiration by the day before Christmas there would be nothing
to do but get her violets, or candy, or perhaps some silly
book that she didn't want.</div>

<p>"Hello, Bob!" said a voice almost at his feet.</p>

<p>"Say Mister Bob, Billy," another voice corrected severely.</p>

<p>"Hello, Jacky! Good evening, Marjorie! Coasting good?"</p>

<p>"Oh, pretty good. You don't know what we've got at our
house!"</p>

<p>"Four Angora kittens!" interrupted Marjorie eagerly, before
Bob had a chance to guess. "Four whole kittens. Can't
see a thing, though, but they'll learn after a while! We're
going to sell three of 'em, and keep one, and&mdash;&mdash;"</p>

<p>"See here, Marjorie!" exclaimed Bob. "I'd like to buy one
myself, for a Christmas present to some one! How about
it? You ask your mother to save one for me&mdash;I'll stop in tomorrow
morning and talk to her about it. Could you take
care of it for me till Christmas morning?"</p><p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_323" id="Page_323">[323]</a></span></p>

<p>And Bob strode on with a happy grin on his face. Wouldn't
Bettina laugh at the idea of an Angora kitten!</p>

<p>For dinner that night Bettina served:</p>

<span class='small'><sup>2</sup>/<sub>3</sub></span> <abbr title="cup">C</abbr>-water<br />

</div>

<p>Look over the cranberries, removing any stems and soft
berries. Add the water and cook until the skins have burst
and all the berries are soft. Press through a strainer, removing
all the pulp. Add the sugar to the pulp, and cook until
the mixture is thick, stirring occasionally to prevent sticking.
When the jelly stands up on a plate it is done. Pour into
moulds (preferably of china or glass) which have been wet
with cold water.</p>


<div class='recipetitle'><b>Burnt Sugar Cake</b> (Sixteen pieces)</div>

<p>Caramelize two-thirds of a cup of sugar. When the sugar
is melted and reaches the light brown or the "caramel" stage,
add the water. Cook until the sugar is thoroughly dissolved
in the water. Allow it to cool. Cream the butter, add the
rest of the uncooked sugar, and then add the egg-yolks. Mix
well. Add the salt, flour, baking-powder, vanilla and the
cooled liquid. Beat two minutes and add the egg-whites
stiffly beaten. Pour into two pans prepared with buttered
paper. Bake twenty-five minutes in a moderate oven. Ice
with confectioner's icing.</p><p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_324" id="Page_324">[324]</a></span></p>

<h2>CHAPTER CII</h2>

<div class='chaptertitle'>A CHRISTMAS BREAKFAST</div>


<div class='cap'>OF course a tiny Christmas tree was the centerpiece on
Bettina's breakfast table, set for a nine o'clock family
breakfast. All of the Christmas gifts except those that were
too large were grouped around the base of the tree. Bettina
refused to allow even Bob to have a peep at the gifts until the
guests, Father, Mother, Uncle John and Aunt Lucy, had arrived.</div>

<p>"Now, don't you give us too much to eat, Bettina," laughed
Father. "I know your mother has been making some mighty
elaborate preparations for dinner at home, and you must leave
us with an appetite."</p>

<p>"Well, you won't have any appetite left if you eat all you
want of these waffles of mine!" exclaimed Bob, coming in
from the kitchen with a spoon in his hand and an apron tied
around his neck.</p>

<p>"Go back to the kitchen, Cook!" said Uncle John. "We
don't want to see you, but we're willing to taste your waffles.
Bring 'em on!"</p>

<p>"First," said Bettina, "we'll eat our grapefruit. Then we'll
open our packages, and then, Bob, you can help me serve the
rest of our Christmas breakfast."</p>

<h2>CHAPTER CIII</h2>

<div class='chaptertitle'>A SUPPER FOR TWO</div>


<div class='cap'>"WELL, this is something like it!" said Bob, as he sat
down to dinner one evening several days after
Christmas. "A good plain meal again. I'm so tired of
Christmas trees and Christmas flowers and Christmas food
that I don't believe I'll care to see any more of them till&mdash;well,
next year."</div>

<p>"Everything is put away now," said Bettina. "All the presents
are in their permanent places. Except Fluff," she added,
glancing at the Persian kitten cuddled in an arm chair. "I
couldn't put Fluff away, and don't care to. Isn't he a darling?
Just the very touch that the living room needed to make it
absolutely homelike!"</p>

<p>"Well," said Bob, "we did need a cat, but I think we need
a dog, too. About next spring I'll get one, if I can find one
to suit me."</p>

<p>"Oh, Bob, won't a dog be a nuisance? And destructive?
And do you suppose Fluff could endure one?"</p>

<p>"Fluff can learn to endure one," Bob said. "Every home
ought to have a dog in it. Oh, we'll get a good dog some day,
Bettina, if I keep my eyes open."</p>

<p>"Have another muffin," said Bettina. "They'll do to change
the subject. Some day I may long for a dog, too, but just
now&mdash;well, Fluff seems to be a pet enough for one house."</p><p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_328" id="Page_328">[328]</a></span></p>

Alice enthusiastically.</div>

<p>"And we have had such delicious
meals since we began to
keep house, if I do say it! But
oh, the bills, the bills! Bettina,
isn't it terrible? But you can't
get any meal at all without paying
for it, can you? I really do
dread having Harry get the first
month's grocery bill, though."</p>

<p>"You ought not to have to say that, Alice," said Bettina,
laughing nevertheless. "Why don't you have an allowance,
and pay the grocery bill yourself?"</p>

<p>"Because I know I could never manage to pay it," said
Alice, making a little face. "I do love to have perfect little
meals and cooking is such fun, but you just can't have things
right without having them expensive; I've found that out.
Last night we had a simple enough dinner&mdash;a very good steak
with French fried potatoes and creamed asparagus on toast.
Then a fruit salad with mayonnaise and steamed suet pudding
and coffee. Harry said everything was perfect, but&mdash;&mdash;"</p>

<p>"I'm sure it was, Alice. You are so clever at everything<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_332" id="Page_332">[332]</a></span>
you do. But wasn't that expensive for just a home dinner
for two? Steak and creamed asparagus! And mayonnaise
is so expensive! Then think of the gas you use, too!"</p>

<p>"I didn't think of the gas," said Alice ruefully. "I thought
of Harry's likes, and of variety, and of a meal that balanced
well. But not much about economy. I'll have to consult you,
Bettina. I'll tell you: Couldn't I plan my menus ahead for
a week, and bring them over to you to criticise? That would
be fun, and I'm sure you could teach me a great deal."</p>

<p>"I'm only too glad to find an excuse, Bettina, but you must

that now is best."</p>

<p>"Well, Bob will take you after dinner. See, I've put on a

fond of it. You know I almost always plan to have two or
more oven dishes if I am using the oven at all, and tonight I
was making baked veal steak."</p>

<p>"I learned something new yesterday, Bettina, that I have
been anxious to tell you. Mother was preparing cabbage for
cold slaw (she always chops it, you know), and it suddenly
occurred to her that she might easily use the large meat
grinder. So she did, and the slaw was delicious. I would
have supposed that the juice would be pressed out in the
grinding, but it wasn't."</p>

<p>"I must remember that. I suppose that other people may

<h2>CHAPTER CVI</h2>

<div class='chaptertitle'>HOW BETTINA MADE CANDY</div>


<div class='cap'>"I &nbsp; RAN over this morning," said Alice to Bettina, "to get
your candy recipes. That was such delicious Christmas
candy that you gave Harry! Wasn't it a great deal of work
to make so much at a time? Perhaps I can't manage it, but
I'd like to make a box of it for Harry's brother; it will be his
birthday in a few days."</div>

<p>"It is very easy to make candy for Christmas boxes," said
Bettina. "That is, it is no harder to make a large quantity
than to fill one box. Bob helped me one evening, and we made
four kinds at once. I had already stuffed some dates and
made some candied orange peel, so you see when the candy
was made, it was fun to fill the boxes with a variety of things.
I always save boxes throughout the year for Christmas candy,
and then I fill them all at once. Of course, until this year I
didn't have Bob to help me; he enjoys it, you know, and two
people can make it so much more quickly than one."</p>

<p>"Next year," said Alice, "I think I shall make Christmas
candy&mdash;a quantity of it, so that I can put a box of it in every
family box that I send. Meanwhile, I'll practise and experiment,
and perhaps I can improve on the good old recipes,
or think of clever ways of arranging and wrapping. Now will
you let me write down some of your best recipes? I'll try
them for Harry's brother."</p>

<p>The candies that Bettina made were:</p>

<div class='chaptertitle'>RUTH'S PLANS</div>


<div class='cap'>"AND so, Bettina," said Ruth, sitting down on the high
stool in Bettina's neat little kitchen, "Fred says we
will begin the house early in the spring&mdash;as early as possible&mdash;and
be married in May or June."</div>

<p>"What perfectly splendid news!" said Bettina. "I'm just
as glad as I can be!"</p>

<p>"We've waited so long," said Ruth, wistfully. "Of course,
if it hadn't been for the war&mdash;it did interfere so with business,
you know&mdash;we would have been married last spring."</p>

<p>"I know," said Bettina, sympathetically, "but you'll be all
the happier because you have waited."</p>

<p>"I'll want you to help me a great deal with my plans," said
Ruth. "I've had time to do lots of sewing, of course, but I
haven't thought anything about the wedding except that it will
be a quiet one. And I want to ask you so much about house
furnishings&mdash;curtains, and all that."</p>

<p>"I'd love to help!" cried Bettina with enthusiasm. "There
isn't anything that is such fun. Oh, Ruth!"</p>

<p>"Gracious me! What?" cried Ruth, for Bettina had jumped
up suddenly.</p>

<p>"Poor Ruth," laughed Bettina, "I didn't mean to frighten
you. I forgot my cake, that was all, and I was afraid it had
burned. But it hasn't. A minute longer though&mdash;you know a
chocolate cake does burn so easily. But it's all right. However,

<p>Wipe the steak with a damp cloth, trim the edges to remove
any gristle, and pound the flour into the meat, using a side
of a heavy plate for the pounding. This breaks up the tendons
of the meat. Place the bacon fat in a frying-pan and
when hot, add the meat. Brown thoroughly on each side.
Lower the flame. Add the bay leaf, salt, pepper, onion and
water. Cover with a lid and allow to cook slowly for one

boils down. Pour the gravy over the meat when serving. This
recipe is good for the fireless.</p>

candied orange peel), and the rose buds in the sunset shades
in the center of the table. "They are almost more real than
real ones! I can scarcely believe that they are made of crêpe
paper."</p>

<p>The square luncheon cloth on the round table was of linen,
decorated with a cross-stitch design in the same sunset shades,
so that the table was all in pink and white. A French basket
enameled in ivory color held the rose buds, and another Christmas
gift to Bettina was the flat ivory basket filled with light
rolls. The luncheon napkins matched the luncheon cloth, as
the guests noted, and "The menu matches everything else!"
exclaimed Alice.</p>

<p>"I'm glad you like it," said Bettina. "I have eaten chicken
a la king often at hotels and restaurants, but until recently it
never occurred to me to make it myself. And it isn't difficult
to make either."</p>

<p>"You must give me the recipe," said Alice. For luncheon
Bettina served:</p><p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_343" id="Page_343">[343]</a></span></p>

necessary after the egg-yolk is added.)</p>


<div class='recipetitle'><b>Bettina Salad</b> (Three portions)</div>

<div class='ingredients1'>
3 slices of pineapple<br />
3 halves of pears<br />

<h2>CHAPTER CIX</h2>

<div class='chaptertitle'>THE DIXONS COME TO DINNER</div>


<div class='cap'>"SHALL I open this jar of grapefruit marmalade?" asked
Charlotte, who was helping Bettina to prepare dinner.</div>

<p>"Yes, Charlotte, if you will."</p>

<p>"How nice it is, Bettina! How long do you cook it before
you add the sugar?"</p>

<p>"Well, that depends altogether on the fruit. Sometimes the
rind is so much tougher than at other times. You cook it until
it's very tender, then add the sugar and cook until it jells."</p>

<p>"There's another thing I'd like to ask you, Bettina. How
on earth do you cut the fruit in thin slices? Isn't it very difficult
to do?"</p>

<p>"Not with a sharp knife. I place the fruit on a hardwood
board, and then if my knife is as sharp as it ought to be, it
isn't at all difficult to cut it thin."</p>

<p>"Well, perhaps I haven't had a sharp enough knife. Oh,
Bettina, what delicious looking cake! Is it fruit cake?"</p>

<p>"It's called date loaf cake. It has nuts in it, too, but no
butter. I always bake it in a loaf cake pan prepared with
waxed paper. Bob is very fond of it. I think it's very good
served with afternoon tea."</p>

<p>"I should think it might be."</p>

<p>"Tonight, though, I am serving just sliced oranges with it."</p>

<p>"That will be a delicious dessert, I think. Listen! Is that
Bob and Frank coming in?"</p><p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_346" id="Page_346">[346]</a></span></p>

1 <abbr title="tablespoon">T</abbr>-spiced peach, chopped fine<br />
1 <abbr title="tablespoon">T</abbr>-pickled melon rind<br />
</div>

<p>Soak the gelatin in cold water for ten minutes. Heat the
vinegar and when very hot pour into the gelatin mixture. Stir
until dissolved. When partially congealed so that the fruit will
not stay on the top, add the pickles, olives, peaches and rind.
Pour into a well-moistened layer mould or four small ones. Set
in a cold place one hour. Unmould.</p>


<div class='recipetitle'><b>Grapefruit Marmalade</b> (One and one-half pints)</div>

<div class='ingredients1'>

</div>

<p>Wash the grapefruit, lemons and orange carefully. Cut
each in quarters. Slice the quarters through the rind and pulp,
making thin slices. Weigh the fruit, and for each pound allow
six cups of cold water. Allow to stand with the water on
the fruit for twenty-four hours. Let all boil gently until the
rind is very tender. No particular test can be given for this,
as some fruit is much tougher than others. Set aside for four
hours. Drain off the liquid. Weigh the fruit mixture, and
for each pound allow a pound of sugar. Let cook slowly until
the mixture thickens or "jellies" when tried on a dish. Be
careful not to get the mixture too thick, as it will thicken somewhat
more upon cooling.</p><p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_347" id="Page_347">[347]</a></span></p>

</div>

<div class='unindent'><span class='letter'>"T</span>HIS was a splendid dinner,
Bettina," said Ruth,
as the two of them were carrying
the dishes into the kitchen and
Fred and Bob were deep in conversation
in the living-room.
"Such a delicious dessert! Suet
pudding, wasn't it? I couldn't
guess all that was in it."</div>

<p>"Just a steamed fig pudding,
Ruth. The simplest thing in the
world!"</p>

<p>"Simple? But don't you have to use a steamer to make it
in, and isn't that awfully complicated? I've always imagined
so."</p>

<p>"You don't need to use a steamer at all. I steamed this in
my fireless cooker, in a large baking powder can. I filled the
buttered can about two-thirds full, and set it in boiling water
that came less than half way up the side of the can. Of course,
the cover of the can or the mould must be screwed on tight.
And the utensil in which it is steamed must be covered. I
used one of the utensils that fit in the fireless, of course, and I
brought the water to a boil on the stove so that I was sure it
was boiling vigorously when I set it in the cooker on the sizzling
hot stone. You see it is very simple. In fact, I think
steaming anything is very easy, for you don't have to keep
watching it as you would if it were baking in the oven, and
basting it, or changing the heat."</p><p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_350" id="Page_350">[350]</a></span></p>

<p>"We haven't a cooker, you know. Could I make a steamed
pudding that same way on the stove?"</p>

<p>"Yes, indeed the very same way. Just set the buttered can
filled two-thirds full in a larger covered utensil holding boiling
water. Keep the water boiling all the time."</p>

<p>"I shall certainly try it tomorrow, Bettina!"</p>

<p>Wipe the meat with a damp cloth, and cut into four pieces.
Mix the egg, water, salt and paprika, and dip each piece of
meat into the egg mixture. Roll in the crumbs and pat the
crumbs into the meat. Place the lard in the frying-pan, and
when hot, add the meat. Brown well on one side, and then
turn, allowing the other side to become the same even color.
Lower the flame under the meat, and cook thirty minutes,
keeping the pan covered. When the meat has cooked twenty-five

of crackers and meat (if there are any) from the bottom of
the pan. If there is no fat left, add butter. Allow the fat to
get hot, and add flour and salt. Mix well with the heated fat,
and allow to brown. Stir constantly, and add the water. Mix
well, and add one-fourth cup of milk. Allow to cook one
minute, stirring constantly. If a thinner sauce is desired, add
another one-fourth of a cup of milk. If a thicker sauce is
desired, allow to cook for two minutes.</p>

at the brilliant tulips on the dinner table. "They make
this a real valentine dinner, although there is nothing festive

to a valentine luncheon at Mary's, and stayed so late&mdash;&mdash;"</div>

<p>"A valentine luncheon? With red hearts everywhere, I suppose?"</p>

<p>"Yes, everything heart-shaped, and in red, too, as far as
possible. Mary had twelve guests at one large round table.
Of course, there were strings and strings of red hearts of various
sizes decorating the table&mdash;not a very new idea, of
course, but so effective. And everything tasted so good; cream
of tomato soup, the best stuffed tenderloin with mushroom
sauce (I must find out how that is made), and the best sweet
potato croquettes!"</p>

<p>"Sweet potato croquettes? That's a new one on me!"</p>

<p>"I'll have to try them some time soon. And Mary had peas
in heart-shaped baking powder biscuits&mdash;the cunningest you
ever saw!&mdash;heart-shaped date bread sandwiches with her
salad, and heart-shaped ice cream with individual heart cakes."</p>

<h2>CHAPTER CXII</h2>

<div class='chaptertitle'>RUTH GIVES A DINNER FOR FOUR</div>


<div class='cap'>BETTINA and Bob arrived at half-past six, as Ruth had
requested.</div>

<p>"She wouldn't let me come earlier, Bob," explained Bettina
as they rang the bell. "I wanted to help her, you know,

was to be the only guest besides ourselves, so she was sure that
she could manage alone. There she is now!"</p>

<p>But it was not Ruth after all.</p>

<p>"Why, Fred; hello!" said Bob. "Did you come early to assist
the cook?"</p>

<p>"I did," said Fred, "but she informed me at once that she
wanted no inexperienced 'help' around. So I've been sitting in
the living-room alone for the last half hour. She did say that I
might answer the bell, but as for doing anything else&mdash;well,
she was positively rude!"</p>

<p>And Fred raised his voice so that its penetrating tones would
reach the kitchen. "The worst of it all is that I've been hungry
as well as lonesome. I might endure sitting alone in the living-room
if I hadn't gone without lunch today in anticipation of
this banquet. And now&mdash;&mdash;"</p>

<p>"Shame on you, Fred!" interrupted Ruth, coming in with
flushed cheeks above her dainty white apron. "Did he receive
you properly?"</p>

<h2>CHAPTER CXIII</h2>

<div class='chaptertitle'>ALICE PRACTISES ECONOMY</div>


<div class='cap'>"OH, Bettina," said Alice, delightedly, as she opened the
door. "I'm so glad to see you! I've just been thinking
about you! What do you suppose I'm doing?"</div>

<p>"Getting dinner? That is what I must be doing very soon.
I stopped in for only a minute on my way home."</p>

<p>"I am getting dinner, and I want to tell you that it is a very
economical dinner. And it's going to be good, too. I thought
and thought about your advice, and decided to practise it. So
I searched through all my cook books for the recipes I wanted,
and finally decided on this particular menu. But, Bettina,
now I can tell you the flaw in your system of economy!"</p>

<p>"What is that? Harry doesn't like it?"</p>

<p>"Goodness no! Harry was delighted with the idea! My
argument is this: It's going to take me an endless amount of
time to plan economical meals that are also good, time that
I ought to spend in polishing silver and making calls, and
sewing on buttons, and&mdash;&mdash;"</p>

<p>"I don't believe it'll be as bad as you think, Alice, dear,"
laughed Bettina. "For instance, if this meal tonight is good
and economical, and Harry is pleased, don't forget the combination,
but write it down in a note-book. You can repeat
the menu in two or three weeks, and you have no idea how
soon you will collect the best combinations, and ideas of economy!
Tell me what you are having tonight."</p>

<h2>CHAPTER CXIV</h2>

<div class='chaptertitle'>A COMPANY DINNER FOR BOB</div>


<div class='cap'>"SOME dinner tonight," remarked Bob, as he sat down
at the table. "Were you expecting company that didn't
show up?"</div>

<p>"No, indeed," laughed Bettina. "I expected just you and
nobody else. But maybe I did cook a little more than usual.
You see I was over at Alice's this afternoon inspecting her
list of next week's menus. You know she is trying to economize,
and she is really doing it, but in spite of economy, Harry
is having elaborate meals. I do hope he appreciates it. Nearly
all of her dinners are three-course affairs, most carefully
planned to look like 'the real thing' as she calls an expensive
dinner. I tell her that hers are the real thing, only
almost too elaborate. You see, she is trying to disguise her
economy so that Harry won't miss the first meals she gave
him. She makes me almost afraid that I'm not feeding you
enough."</p>

<p>"No danger of that," said Bob, emphatically. "But what
are all these economical things she is serving?"</p>

<p>"Wait, I wrote some of them down. Listen. Here is one:</p>

<h2>CHAPTER CXV</h2>

<div class='chaptertitle'>SUPPER AFTER THE THEATRE</div>


<div class='cap'>"NOW, Bob, you start the fire in the fireplace while I
go into the kitchen and get a little lunch."</div>

<p>"Mrs. Bob," said Donald, an old school-friend of Bob's,
"I don't want you to do any such thing! We don't need any
lunch! Stay in here and we'll all talk."</p>

<p>"You'll talk all the better for something to eat," said Bettina,
"and so will Bob. Won't you, Bob?"</p>

<p>"Well," said Bob, with a grin, "I will admit that coming
home in the cold has given me something of an appetite.
Then too, I'll tell you, Donald, that Bettina's after-theatre
suppers aren't to be lightly refused! Yes, on the whole, I
think we'd better have the supper. We couldn't get you for
dinner tonight, and you're leaving so early in the morning
that you see you won't have had any real meal at our house
at all!"</p>

<p>Meanwhile, Bettina was busying herself with the little
supper, for which she had made preparations that morning.
When she had creamed the oysters and placed them in the
ramekins, she popped them in the oven. Next she put on the
coffee in her percolator, and placed in the oven with the
oysters the small loaf of bran bread that she had steamed
that morning. "Bob likes it better warm," she said to herself.</p>

<p>Then she arranged her tea-cart with plates, cups, silver,
napkins and peach preserves, not forgetting the rice parfait
from the refrigerator.</p>

<p>When she wheeled the little supper into the living room,
Bob and Donald welcomed her with delight. "I take it back;
I am hungry after all!" said Donald.</p><p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_364" id="Page_364">[364]</a></span></p>

<p>"I like that recipe," said Bettina, "and it is so easy
to make."</p>

<p>"What have you been doing all day?" Bob asked, "Cooking?"</p>

<p>"No, indeed. Charlotte was here this afternoon and we
made plans for the tea we are going to give at her house on
Washington's birthday. Oh, Bob, we have some of the best
ideas for it! Our refreshments are to be served from the dining-room
table, you know, and our central decoration is to be
a three-cornered black hat filled with artificial red cherries.
Of course we'll have cherry ice, and serve cherries in the tea,
Russian style. The salad will be served in little black three-cornered
hats; these filled with fruit salad, will be set on the
table and each guest will help herself. The thin bread and
butter sandwiches will be cut in hatchet shape. And&mdash;oh, yes,
I forgot the cunningest idea of all! We'll serve tiny gilt hatchets
stuck in tree-trunks of fondant rolled in cocoanut and
toasted brown. Isn't that a clever plan? Charlotte saw it
done once, and says it is very effective."</p>

<p>"It sounds like some party! And I'll feel especially enthusiastic
if you don't forget to plan for one guest who won't
appear&mdash;or perhaps I should say two, for I know Frank won't
want to be forgotten."</p>

<h2>CHAPTER CXVII</h2>

<div class='chaptertitle'>AN AFTERNOON WITH BETTINA</div>


<div class='cap'>WHEN Bettina pushed her tea cart into the living-room,
Alice and Ruth laid aside the mending at which they
had been busy.</div>

<p>"What delicious toast, Bettina!" said Alice, taking one bite.
"Why, it has cinnamon on it! And sugar! I wondered what
on earth you were making that smelled so good, and this is
something new to me!"</p>

<p>"It is cinnamon toast," said Bettina, "and so easy to make.
I was busy all morning, and didn't have time to make anything
but these date kisses for tea, but cinnamon toast can be
made so quickly that I decided to serve it."</p>

<p>"I like orange marmalade, too, Bettina," said Alice. "I
wish I had made some. I have spiced peaches, and a little
jelly, but that is all. Next summer I intend to have a perfect
orgy of canning. Then my cupboard will be even better
stocked than Bettina's&mdash;perhaps! I opened a jar of spiced
peaches last evening for dinner, and what do you think! Harry
ate every peach in the jar! I had expected them to last several
days, too."</p>

<p>"I hoped you saved the juice," said Bettina.</p>

<p>"I did, but I don't know why. It seemed too good to throw
away, somehow."</p>

<p>"Have you ever eaten ham cooked in the juice of pickled
peaches? It's delicious. Just cover the slice of ham with the
juice and cook it in the oven until it is very tender. Then
remove it from the juice and serve it."</p>

<p>"It sounds fine. I'll do it tomorrow."</p><p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_369" id="Page_369">[369]</a></span></p>

<h2>CHAPTER CXVIII</h2>

<div class='chaptertitle'>A WASHINGTON'S BIRTHDAY TEA</div>


<div class='cap'>WHEN the tea guests were ushered into Charlotte's dining-room
that afternoon, they were delighted with the
table and its red, white and blue decorations. In the center
was a large three-cornered hat made of black paper, and
heaped with artificial red cherries. The cherry ice was tinted
red, and served in sherbet glasses. A large white cake, uncut,
was one of the chief decorations, for halves of red cherries
were placed together on it to represent a bunch of cherries,
while tiny lines of chocolate icing represented the stems.</div>

<p>Bettina poured the tea and placed in each cup a red cherry.
The guests helped themselves to trays, napkins, forks and
spoons, and each took a portion of Washington salad, served
in a small, black, three-cornered hat, lined with waxed paper.
Each took also a rolled sandwich, tied with red, white and blue
ribbon, and a nut bread sandwich in the shape of a hatchet.</p>

<p>The Washington fondant, rolled in cocoanut and toasted to
represent tree trunks, with small gilt hatchets stuck in them,
occasioned great delight. "How did you ever think of it?"
Ruth asked, and Bettina gave Charlotte the credit, though she
in turn disclaimed any originality in the matter.</p>

<p>"One thing is lacking," said Bettina. "Charlotte and I
should be wearing colonial costumes. We did think of it, but
happened to be too busy to make them."</p>

<p>That afternoon Charlotte and Bettina served:</p><p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_371" id="Page_371">[371]</a></span></p>

<h2>CHAPTER CXIX</h2>

<div class='chaptertitle'>ANOTHER OVEN DINNER</div>


<div class='cap'>BETTINA heard a step on the porch, and quickly laying
aside her kitchen apron, rushed to the door to meet Bob.
Her rather hilarious greeting was checked just in time, at sight
of a tall figure behind him.</div>

<p>"Bettina, this is Mr. MacGregor, of MacGregor &amp; Hopkins,
you know. Mr. MacGregor, my wife, Bettina. I've been trying
to get you all afternoon to tell you I was bringing a guest
to dinner and to spend the night. The storm seems to have
affected the lines."</p>

<p>"Oh, it has! I've been alone all day! Haven't talked to a
soul! Welcome, Mr. MacGregor, I planned Bob's particular
kind of a dinner tonight, and it may not suit you at all, but
I'm glad to see you, anyhow."</p>

<p>Mr. MacGregor murmured something dignified but indistinct,
as Bob cried out heartily, "Well, it smells good, anyhow,
so I guess you can take a chance; eh, MacGregor?"</p>

<p>Bettina had a hazy idea that Mr. MacGregor, of MacGregor
&amp; Hopkins, was somebody very important with whom Bob's
firm did business, and although she knew also that Bob had
know "Mac," as he called him, years before in a way that was
slightly more personal, her manner was rather restrained as
she ushered them into the dining-room a few minutes later.
However, the little meal was so appetizing, and the guest
seemed so frankly appreciative, that conversation soon flowed
freely. Bob's frank comments were sometimes embarrassing,
for instance when he said such things as this:</p><p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_374" id="Page_374">[374]</a></span></p>

<p>"Matrimony has taught me a lot, MacGregor! I've learned&mdash;well,
now, you'd never think that all this dinner was cooked
in the oven, would you? Well, it was: baked ham, baked
potatoes, baked apples, and the cakes&mdash;Bettina's cakes, I call
'em. You see, my wife thinks of things like that&mdash;a good dinner
and saving gas, too!"</p>

<p>"Oh, Bob!" said Bettina, with a scarlet face.</p>

<p>"You needn't be embarrassed, Bettina, it's so! I was just
telling 'Mac' as we came in, that two can live more cheaply
than one provided the other one is like you&mdash;always coaxing
me to add to our bank account. It's growing, too, and I never
could save before I was married!"</p>

<p>The dinner consisted of:</p>

<h2>CHAPTER CXX</h2>

<div class='chaptertitle'>BOB MAKES POP-OVERS</div>


<div class='cap'>BETTINA was busily setting the table in the dining-room
when Bob appeared.</div>

<p>"Oh, Bettina," said he in a disappointed tone, "why not eat
in the breakfast alcove? I'd like to show MacGregor how
much fun we have every morning."</p>

<p>"Won't he think we're being too informal?"</p>

<p>"I want him to think us informal. The trouble with him
is that he doesn't know that any simple brand of happiness
exists. His life is too complex. Of course we're not exactly
primitive&mdash;with our electric percolator and toaster&mdash;&mdash;"</p>

<p>"Sorry, Bob, but you can't use the toaster this morning; I'm
about to stir up some pop-overs."</p>

<p>"Well, I'll forgive you for taking away my toy, inasmuch
as I do like pop-overs. Let me help you with them, Bettina;
this is one place where you can use my strong right arm."</p>

<p>"Yes, indeed I can, Bob. I'll never forget those splendid
pop-overs that you made the first time you ever tried. They
look simple, but not very many people can make good ones.
The secret of it is all in the beating," said she, as she stirred
up the smooth paste, "and then in having the gem pans and
the oven very hot."</p>

<p>"Well, these'll be good ones then," said Bob, as he set about
his task. "You light the oven, Betty, and put the gem pans in
it, and then before you have changed things from the dining-room
to the alcove, I'll have these pop-overs popping away
just as they ought to do!"</p>

<p>The percolator was bubbling and the pop-overs were nearly
done when they heard Mr. MacGregor's step. "He's exactly<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_377" id="Page_377">[377]</a></span>
on time," chuckled Bob. "That's the kind of a methodical fellow
he is in everything."</p>

<p>"Well, there's no time when promptness is more appreciated
than at meal-time," said Betty, decidedly. "I like him."</p>

<p>"Come on out here!" called Bob, cheerfully. "This is the
place in which we begin the day! We'll show you the kind of
a breakfast that'll put some romance into your staid old head.
I made the pop-overs myself, and I know they're the best you
ever saw&mdash;likewise the biggest&mdash;and they'll soon be the best
you've ever eaten!"</p>

<p>When Bob had finished removing the pop-overs from their
pans, the two men took their places at the table to the merry
tune of the sizzling bacon Bettina was broiling.</p>

<p>"I never entertained a stranger so informally before," said
she.</p>

<p>"And I was never such a comfortable guest as I am at this
minute," said Mr. MacGregor, looking down at his breakfast,
which consisted of:</p>

<p>Add the milk slowly to the flour and salt, stirring constantly,
until a smooth paste is formed. Beat and add the remainder
of the milk, and the egg. Beat vigorously for three minutes.
Fill very hot gem pans three-fourths full. Bake thirty minutes
in a hot oven. They are done when they have "popped" at
least twice their size, and when they slip easily out of the pan.
Iron pans are the best.</p>

<div class='unindent'><span class='letter'>"S</span>PRING is in the air,"
thought Bettina, as she
opened the casement windows
of her sun room. "I believe we'll
have dinner out here tonight. If
Bob would only come home
early, before the sun goes down!
Now I wonder who that can be!"
(For she heard a knock at the
kitchen door.)</div>

<p>"Why, Charlotte. Come in!"
she cried a moment later, for it was Mrs. Dixon with a napkin-covered
pan in hand, whom she found at the door.</p>

<p>"I've brought you some light rolls for your dinner, Bettina,"
said Charlotte. "I don't make them often, and when I
do, I make more than we can eat. Will they fit into your dinner
menu?"</p>

<p>"Indeed they will!" said Bettina. "I'm delighted to get
them. Now I wish I had something to send back with you
for your dinner, but I seem to have cooked too little of everything!"</p>

<p>"Don't you worry," said Charlotte, heartily. "When I think
of all the things you've done for me, I'm only too glad to offer
you anything I have! Well, I must hurry home to get our
dinner. That reminds me, Bettina, to ask you this: When
you escallop anything, do you dot the crumbs on top with
butter?"</p>

<p>"No, Charlotte, I melt the butter, add the crumbs, stir them<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_380" id="Page_380">[380]</a></span>
well, and then spread them on the top of the escalloped oysters,

<h2>CHAPTER CXXII</h2>

<div class='chaptertitle'>A FIRELESS COOKER FOR AUNT LUCY</div>


<div class='cap'>"WELL, Uncle John! Hello!" said Bob, as he came
into the kitchen. "Is Aunt Lucy here, too?"</div>

<p>"No, she isn't," said Uncle John, shaking his head solemnly,
"and the fact is, I shouldn't be here myself if it weren't for a
sort of conspiracy; eh, Bettina?"</p>

<p>"That's so, Bob," said Bettina, coming in from the dining-room,
her hands full of dishes, "and now I suppose we'll have
to let you in on the secret. Uncle John has just bought a
beautiful new fireless cooker for Aunt Lucy. Haven't you,
Uncle John?"</p>

<p>"Well!" said Bob, heartily. "That's fine! How did you
happen to think of it?"</p>

<p>"Well Bob, she's been dreading the summer on the farm&mdash;not
feeling so very strong lately, you know&mdash;and this morning
she was just about discouraged. It's next to impossible
to get any help out there&mdash;she says she's given up that idea&mdash;and
at breakfast she told me that if the spring turned out to be
a hot, uncomfortable one, she believed she'd go out and spend
the summer with Lem's girl in Colorado. I naturally hate to
have her do that, so I concluded to do everything I could to
keep her at home. I telephoned to Bettina, and she promised
to help me. The very first thing she suggested was a fireless
cooker, and we bought that today. I believe your Aunt Lucy'll
like it, too."</p>

<p>For dinner Bettina served:</p>

<div class='cap'>"COME in! Come in!" cried Bob to the Dixons. "You're
just in time to have dessert with us! Bettina, here are
the Dixons!"</div>

<p>"Do sit down," said Bettina, "and have some Boston cream
pie with us!"</p>

<p>"Frank won't need urging," said Charlotte. "Our dessert
tonight was apple sauce, and Boston cream pie (whatever it
is) sounds too enticing to be resisted."</p>

<p>"It looks a little like the Washington pie my mother used
to make," said Frank. "Only that wasn't so fancy on the
top."</p>

<p>"Washington pie needs whipped cream to make it perfect,"
said Bettina, "and as I had no whipped cream I made this with
a meringue."</p>

<p>"Dessert with the neighbors!" said Frank, laughing. "Charlotte
read me a suggestion the other day that sounded sensible.
A housewife had introduced a new custom into her
neighborhood. Whenever she had planned a particularly good
dessert she would phone a few of her friends not to plan any
dessert for themselves that evening, but to stroll over after
dinner and have dessert with her family. Wasn't that an
idea? It might lead to cooperative meals! We haven't done
our share; have we? We should have telephoned to you to
have the main course with us tonight. Say, Bettina, I like this
Boston cream pie! It's what I call a real dessert!"</p><p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_385" id="Page_385">[385]</a></span></p>

</div>

<div class='recipetitle'><b>Carrots</b></div>

<p>Wash and scrape the carrots thoroughly, cover with boiling
water, and allow to boil until tender when pierced with a knitting
needle or a fork. (About twenty minutes.) Drain and
serve with sauce. Carrots may be cut into three-fourth inch
cubes or any fancy shapes, and will cook in less time.</p>

<div class='recipetitle'><b>White Sauce for Carrots</b></div>

<p>Melt butter, add the flour, salt and paprika. Mix well.
Gradually add the milk, and cook the sauce until creamy.</p>


<div class='recipetitle'><b>Baked Potatoes</b> (Two portions)</div>

<div class='ingredients1'>
2 potatoes<br />
</div>

<p>Wash thoroughly two medium-sized potatoes. With the
sharp point of the knife, make a small cut around the potato
to allow the starch grains to expand. Bake the potato in a
moderate oven until it feels soft and mealy, when pressed with
the hands. (About forty-five minutes.) Break open the potato
to allow the steam to escape. (Turn the potato about in
the oven to insure evenness in baking.)</p>

<p>Wash and core the apples. Mix the sugar, cinnamon, vanilla

boiler, stirring occasionally to prevent lumping. Add vanilla
and remove from the fire. When partially cool, spread part of
the filling over one layer of the cake. Allow to stand five minutes
and then add more filling. Allow to stand two minutes.

<div class='chaptertitle'>RUTH PASSES BY</div>


<div class='cap'>"M&mdash;M!" said Ruth, walking into Bettina's kitchen late
one afternoon. "What is it that smells so perfectly
delicious?"</div>

<p>"Lamb stew," said Bettina. "Bob is particularly fond of it,
and we haven't had it for a long time. This is such a cold
day that I thought lamb stew would taste very good tonight."</p>

<p>"And what are you making now?"</p>

<p>"Soft gingerbread. It's just ready to pop into the oven, and
then I can go into the living-room with you and we'll visit
in state."</p>

<p>"Don't, Bettina. I'd much rather talk in your shining little
kitchen with the kettle bubbling on the hearth (only it's a gas
stove and you won't let it bubble long if you think of your
gas bill). 'Kitchen Konfidences!' What a name for a nice
little domestic science book!"</p>

<p>"Well, we'll stay in the kitchen then, and exchange kitchen
konfidences. Where have you been this afternoon in your
big woolly coat?"</p>

<p>"Down town to the market. And I did get something besides
food&mdash;a small purchase that you advised me to buy. A
box of labels&mdash;plain label stickers, you know&mdash;to stick on the
boxes that I put away&mdash;out of season things and all that. I've
noticed how neatly all your stored-away things are labeled."</p>

<p>"It saves so much time in finding things. And a label looks
better than writing on the box, for the labels are white and
very often the box is dark pasteboard, and pencil marks are
difficult to see."</p>

<div class='level'>(All measurements are level)</div>


<div class='recipetitle'><b>Lamb Stew</b> (Four portions)</div>

<div class='ingredients1'>
1½ lbs. lamb (from the shoulder)<br />
3 <abbr title="tablespoon">T</abbr>-lard<br />

½ <abbr title="cup">C</abbr>-diced carrots<br />
</div>

<p>Wipe the meat with a damp cloth, and cut into two-inch
pieces. Place the lard in a frying-pan, and when hot, add the
onion cut fine and allow to brown. Add the meat and brown.
Add the boiling water to the meat and onion, and cook one
minute. Pour all of the contents of the frying-pan into a
sauce pan, and let it cook slowly for one hour. Increase the
heat a little to allow the stew to boil occasionally. Add the
potatoes cut in one-inch cubes, and the diced carrots. In
twenty minutes, add a cup of canned tomato pulp or fresh tomatoes
to the stew. Add the seasoning (salt and cloves), and
cook ten minutes. This allows two hours for the entire stew.
If at this time the stew does not seem thick enough, mix four
tablespoons of water very slowly with two level tablespoons
of flour, stir thoroughly, and pour slowly into the stew. Allow
to cook two minutes and serve.</p>


<div class='recipetitle'><b>Soft Gingerbread</b> (Twelve pieces)</div>

<div class='cap'>"INDEED I will keep Kathleen for you," said Bettina to
Mrs. Fulton. "I'll enjoy it. We'll have to invent some
new plays and have such a jolly time that she won't miss her

"If mother were only stronger, I would leave her
there&mdash;&mdash;"</p>

<p>"Go right on, Mrs. Fulton, and don't worry one bit! Kathleen
and I are going to have the time of our lives! Let's see&mdash;it's

<p>"Well, she had an early lunch, and has just wakened from
her nap. Perhaps she is a little hungry. Are you?"</p>

<p>"Bed'n delly," replied Kathleen with emphasis.</p>

<p>"Oh, I know something that's better for little girls than
bread and jelly!" said Bettina, lifting the roly-poly little mite
onto the kitchen table. "I'll make her some good cream toast!
May I, Mrs. Fulton?"</p>

<p>"Indeed, you may, if you will," said Mrs. Fulton. "I'm
afraid she won't always eat it, though. Well, I'll have to go, I
suppose, if I get to sister Annie's train on time. Then we'll do
a little shopping down town, and I'll be back for Kathleen at
six o'clock sharp."</p>

<p>"Just whenever it's convenient for you, Mrs. Fulton. Good-bye!"</p>

<p>"Doodby," echoed Kathleen, apparently without the least regret.</p>

cracker cake for Uncle Bob. But first we'll clean some white
gloves! Shall we?"</p>

<p>Kathleen nodded solemnly, her mouth full of "dood tream
toast."</p>

<p>"Well, watch me then, honey-lamb. See, I'll put these dirty
old gloves in this nice Mason jar of clean gasoline, and let 'em
soak awhile. Then once in a while I'll shake 'em up like this.
Then by and by I'll rinse 'em in nice new gasoline, and they'll
be just as white as new. Did you know that, Kathleen?"</p>

<p>"'Es," said Kathleen, staring wisely.</p>

<p>"Oh, you little owl! You knew more than Aunt Bettina
then&mdash;at least than I knew till yesterday, for I always thought
it necessary to rub white gloves to get them clean. See? This
way I'll drop them down in the gasoline, and won't need to
soil my hands at all! I'll get them out with a clean little stick
or a long fork. There! Now, are we all ready to make the

<p>"What is that brown paper for?"</p>

<p>"To put under the dishes I'm warming. It breaks the heat
and prevents cracking. There, that cream sauce has cooked
enough now. I'll take it and beat it for a minute. See? There,
now it's ready for the egg and the chicken mixture."</p>

<p>"Shall I stir it now? Don't you put it back over the fire?"</p>

<p>"Just for a minute. You see, if any custard or egg sauce
is allowed to cook more than a minute after the egg has been
added, it will curdle."</p>

<h2>CHAPTER CXXVII</h2>

<div class='chaptertitle'>A SHAMROCK LUNCHEON</div>


<div class='cap'>BETTINA was entertaining "the crowd" at a shamrock
luncheon, and each guest, to show her enthusiasm for the
charms of "ould Ireland," was wearing somewhere upon her
gown, a bit of green.</div>

<p>A green basket filled with white carnations and green foliage
stood in the center of the table. White glass candlesticks
with green shades also carried out the color scheme,
while white crocheted favor baskets, filled with dainty green
candies, were at each plate. The table was set for six.</p>

<p>The name cards were white shamrocks outlined with green
ink and edged with gilt, and the name on each was written in
green.</p>

<p>Bettina used green ferns for decoration in every possible
place where they might add to the attractiveness of the table,
under the glass dishes and around the baskets containing rolls,
cakes and croutons.</p>

<p>"You might be Irish yourself, Bettina," said Mary, "you
have such a feeling for green! And isn't the table lovely,
girls!"</p>

<p>For luncheon Bettina served:</p>

cubes. Place in a bowl, add the sugar and allow to stand
in a cold place for one hour. Arrange the servings in six
sherbet glasses. Place one green cherry on the top of each and

<h2>CHAPTER CXXVIII</h2>

<div class='chaptertitle'>AT DINNER</div>


<div class='cap'>"MARY gave a waffle party today," announced Bettina at
the dinner table.</div>

<p>"A waffle party in the afternoon?" said Bob. "That was
queer! Usually at afternoon parties you women serve tiny
little cups of tea and dainty olive sandwiches, almost too small
to be visible; don't you? Waffles are more sensible, I think,
but it seems a shame that we men had to miss such a party."</p>

<p>"Well, I'm afraid I'll have to acknowledge that we had a
very good time without you," laughed Bettina, wickedly. "It
has been cold today, you know, and Mary's kitchen was so
warm and bright and cozy! We all went out there and took
turns baking the waffles. We consumed a large number of
them, and had a very jolly informal kind of time. We housekeepers
compared notes and gave each other advice and really
learned a great many things."</p>

<p>"Such as&mdash;&mdash;"</p>

<p>"Well, Alice tells me that when she makes a devil's food
cake she removes all of the melted chocolate from the pan by
adding a little flour which mixes in thoroughly and saves any
waste of chocolate. Surely that is worth knowing."</p>

<p>"It certainly is, though I'll admit that I don't quite understand
your language."</p>

<p>"Well, cheer up, Bob! There are times when I confess that
I don't quite understand the automobile explanations you so
often give me of late!"</p>

<h2>CHAPTER CXXIX</h2>

<div class='chaptertitle'>AN ANNIVERSARY DINNER</div>


<div class='cap'>"THIS is some dinner, Bettina!" said Bob, over his dessert.
"It's like a celebration, somehow, with the
pink candles on the table, and the flowers, and the company
menu. Why, Bettina, I do believe it is an anniversary!
Isn't it? Let me see! The second anniversary of
our engagement!"</div>

<p>"I've been waiting to see if you would remember that,
Bob, and I must say that I'm a little ashamed of you! After
all, it took the pink candles and the company dinner to
make you think of it! Well, I suppose men are all alike!"
And she sighed the sigh of deep disillusionment.</p>

<p>Bob waited for a moment to see the dimple reappear in
her cheek, and the twinkle in her eyes, and then he, too,
sighed&mdash;a sigh of relief.</p>

<p>"Bless your heart, Bettina, don't you sigh like that again!
You almost had me thinking that you were in earnest. Now
you took the very nicest way to remind me of that anniversary.
Instead of feeling neglected like some women&mdash;&mdash;"</p>

<p>"What do you know about 'some women,' Bob?"</p>

<p>"Only what I've read in books&mdash;&mdash;"</p>

<p>"Well, the books don't know. But I give you fair warning,
Bob, that on the next anniversary you fail to remember,
I'll feed you bread and milk, and not chicken."</p>

<p>"This is a fine dessert," said Bob meekly and tactfully.</p><p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_400" id="Page_400">[400]</a></span></p>

<p>"Do you like it? I enjoy making it, it looks so light and
fluffy. I pile it very lightly into the glass dish to make it
that way. I prefer gelatin in glass dishes, don't you, Bob?"</p>

<p>"You bet I do! Everything about this anniversary dinner
is fine except for my own stupidity!"</p>

<h2>CHAPTER CXXX</h2>

<div class='chaptertitle'>RUTH COMES TO DINNER</div>


<div class='cap'>"HOW do you like this kind of meat, Ruth?" asked Bob.
"It is a little invention of Bettina's own. I call it a
symphony and no 'mis-steak.'"</div>

<p>"It is an economy, not a symphony," said Bettina, "but
if it leads you to make such dreadful puns as that, I'll wish
I had fed you something else for dinner."</p>

<p>"To me," said Ruth, "this dish is a delicacy and a despair.
How can you think of things like this? I know I
never could do it in the wide world!"</p>

<p>"I can't compose symphonies or poems," said Bettina,
"so I express myself in this way. And most of my music
is played in a simple key. It is difficult to think of a variety
of inexpensive meat dishes, and sometimes I have to invent
them in order to keep within my allowance, and still vary
my menus. Creamed onions are economical and healthful,
too, so you see that my whole dinner is inexpensive."</p>

<p>"And also delicious," said Ruth. "I don't see how you
manage to keep cooked onions from having a strong smell,
and to keep the house so free from the odor."</p>

<div class='poem2'>
"O that someone would patent<br />
<span style="margin-left: 0.5em;">That someone would patent and sell</span><br />
<span style="margin-left: 0.5em;">An onion with an onion taste</span><br />
<span style="margin-left: 0.5em;">And with a violet smell,"</span><br />
</div>

<div class='unindent'>quoted Bob.</div><p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_403" id="Page_403">[403]</a></span></p>

<p>"Well," said Bettina, "I'm afraid that a house in which
onions have recently been cooking, can't be entirely free
from the odor, but I largely overcome the difficulty by
peeling them under cold water, and then cooking them in
an uncovered vessel. Then, too, I wonder if you know that
boiling them for five minutes and then draining them and
covering them with boiling water again&mdash;even draining
them twice and finishing the cooking in fresh boiling water&mdash;is
a splendid thing for taking away the strong taste."</p>

<p>"No, I didn't know that. Bettina, dear, your kind of
apple sauce is as fine a dessert as I ever ate."</p>

<p>"You're good to say so, Ruth. I was afraid when I urged
you to stay tonight that you might think this meal very
plain and simple for a guest, but I know it is healthful and
economical and Bob seems to thrive, so I'll not be remorseful."</p>

<p>"Just let me ask you what gives this apple sauce such a delicate
flavor. It isn't a bit like common, ordinary apple
sauce."</p>

<p>"I don't know; maybe it's the butter. I always put that
in, and a few grains of salt. This has also a thin slice of
lemon cooked in it&mdash;rind and all&mdash;and of course there is a
little cinnamon, though some people prefer nutmeg. Then
I try to be careful in putting in the sugar, for I know that
some apples require more than others. These were tart
apples; I like them better for apple sauce."</p>

<div class='poem'>
"The reason why I'm never cross<br />
<span style="margin-left: 0.5em;">Is 'cause I'm fed on apple sauce,"</span><br />
</div>

<div class='unindent'>remarked Bob complacently.</div>

"But I am sure you'd fret and cry<br />

<p>"I set the table, Uncle Bob, and I made the rice croquettes
into that cunning shape, and when they were fried,
I put in the jelly! Don't they look nice?"</p>

<p>"Well, you're a great little helper, Mildred, aren't you!"</p>

<p>"That's just what Aunt Bettina says. And I've learned
so many things! I didn't know before that it was easier
to cut up marshmallows with the scissors than any other
way. Oh, Aunt Bettina! I almost told him about our dessert!"</p>

<p>"Marshmallows? Marshmallows?" said Bob. "A clue,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_411" id="Page_411">[411]</a></span>

<p>"Your bungalow will have to be larger than this to accommodate
them all if you adopt seven or eight."</p>

<p>"I don't want a large one; that would spoil the fun. I'll

<p>"Yes, dear. Put half a cup of white flour in that frying-pan
over the fire and keep stirring it constantly until it is a

<p>"You did?" said Bob, feigning astonishment. "You rolled
them out with a rolling pin, I suppose, and&mdash;&mdash;"</p>

<p>"Oh, no, Uncle Bob! You ought never to use a rolling
pin, Aunt Bettina says!" said Mildred in a horrified tone, as
if she had been cooking for the First Families for a score
of years. "Good cooks always pat down the dough&mdash;they
never roll it out."</p>

<p>"Well, what do you do first? Stir up the dough with a
spoon?"</p>

<p>"No, indeed; you use a knife. Then you pat the dough
down, and cut out the dear little biscuits with a biscuit
cutter."</p>

<p>"And put them side by side in a nicely buttered pan? I
know how!"</p>

<p>"But you don't butter the pan," said Mildred triumphantly.
"Or flour it, either. Aunt Bettina says that lots
of people think the pan has to be buttered or floured, but
they're wrong. It's lots better to put the biscuits into a nice
clean pan."</p>

<p>"But don't they stick to it, and burn?"</p>

<p>"No, indeed! They don't burn a bit! Look at these!"
said Mildred, delighted to find the opportunity to impart

<h2>CHAPTER CXXXVII</h2>

<div class='chaptertitle'>A LUNCHEON FOR POLLY</div>


<div class='cap'>"NOW that this delicious little luncheon is over, Bettina,"
said Alice, "I want to ask you something.
How did you make the croquettes that cunning shape?"</div>

<p>"With a conical ice cream mould, Alice," Bettina answered.
"It is very simple. And I'll tell you another thing.
I made those croquettes yesterday, not today."</p>

<p>"You don't mean that you fried them yesterday?"</p>

<p>"Yes, I did, Alice. In deep fat."</p>

<p>"But they were warm, not cold."</p>

<p>"Yes, for I reheated them in the oven a few minutes before
I served them. They really are as good as new when
treated that way. I had always supposed that croquettes
had to be served immediately after they were fried, and you
know frying in deep fat is really a nuisance when it has to
be done at the last minute. For instance, today I had the
biscuits to make, and the soup and sweet potatoes to prepare.
And I believe in being leisurely when giving a
luncheon, so I certainly would not serve croquettes if they
had to be made that day. I tried reheating them once when
Bob and I were here alone and discovered that they were
delicious. So I've always, ever since, fried my croquettes
the day before."</p>

<p>"Hereafter I'll serve croquettes at luncheon myself," said
Alice. "You have taught me something."</p>

<div class='cap'>"A &nbsp; PENNY for your thoughts!"</div>

<p>Bettina started in surprise. "Why, Ruth, I didn't
see you coming up the walk!"</p>

<p>"I knew you didn't. But what on earth are you doing out
here on your front steps? Enjoying the weather?"</p>

<p>"Indeed I am! Isn't it a wonderful spring day? But my
thoughts weren't very poetic, I must admit. I was just
wondering if it was too early to put away my furs for the
summer. I'm always tempted to do that when the first
signs of spring appear, and then I'm generally sorry a few
days later."</p>

<p>"I'll have to put mine away soon, too. Do tell me, Bettina,
just how you go about it."</p>

<p>"Well, I always hang mine in the sun for a while, then I
beat them well, comb them out with a steel comb, and
wrap them up."</p>

<p>"With moth-balls?"</p>

<p>"That is a good way, but not at all necessary. I always
wrap mine in a newspaper&mdash;a good tight package. Moths
don't like printer's ink, you know, and furs so wrapped are
perfectly safe."</p>

<p>"Then, Bettina, you don't need to add that you label the
package, for I know that you do, you thoroughly thorough
housekeeper!"</p>

<p>Bettina laughed. "Well, Ruth, I do label it. Labelled
packages are so much better to have, for very often you
need to get something out in a hurry."</p>

<div class='chaptertitle'>PLANNING A CHILDREN'S PARTY</div>


<div class='cap'>"OF course, I'll help you, Ruth," said Bettina. "I'd
love to. A children's party! What fun it will be!
How many children will be there?"</div>

<p>"Twelve or fifteen, I think. Now let me tell you Ralph's
own idea for entertainment. I suppose I'm a doting aunt,
but it sounds very possible to me."</p>

<p>"Did Ralph suggest the kind of a party he wished? Well,
isn't he a clever boy! And he's only eleven years old,
too."</p>

<p>"He suggested that the invitations invite the children to
a circus. You see, we could write a little rhyme to that
effect on animal paper, or with an animal picture pasted in
the corner. When the children arrive, we'll have the parade.
We'll have ready the horns, drums, and so forth, for the
band, and some of the children will represent the various
wild animals. The parade will lead to the refreshment table
(after some circus games, perhaps), which will be set outdoors
if it is warm enough. The table must represent a
circus ground (I've seen those paper circuses downtown,
haven't you?), and the refreshments must carry out the
scheme. So, Bettina, do help us to plan the details!"</p>

<h2>CHAPTER CXL</h2>

<div class='chaptertitle'>THE PARTY CIRCUS</div>


<div class='cap'>RUTH and Bettina led "the parade," the band at its
head, to the cheerful sunroom, where the table had
been set. At sight of the "party" spread before them, the
young musicians and the others gave a sudden shriek of
delight.</div>

<p>"It's a circus!" explained Ralph to curly-headed Margery,
who was adding her own piping voice to the general din.</p>

<p>A small American flag floated from a flag pole in the
center of the table, and around it were arranged paper
circus tents and circus wagons of the five and ten cent
store variety. Animal crackers were all about, and the
animal sandwiches and animal cakes in flat baskets looked
almost too real to be eaten.</p>

<p>Smooth boards on supports represented circus seats, and
on these the children soon clambered, eager to eat as children
always are.</p>

<p>The paper napkins, decorated with animals, were folded
before the places to represent tents. The salad faces, which
Ralph called "clowns," leered up from the plates.</p>

<p>But the joy was not to be all in seeing. There was a
favor for each child to carry away, the favors from the
table being claimed by matching the numbers on each one
with a corresponding number on the pieces of candy passed
at the close of the meal.</p>

<div class='chaptertitle'>PLANNING A LUNCHEON</div>


<div class='cap'>"IT won't be hard, Ruth, if you plan it out in detail
several days before. Decide on the menu, and if you
find that some one dish is going to cause more trouble than
it's worth, plan something else in its place."</div>

<p>"I think it's a lovely thing for you to do, Ruth. Now
let me tell you how I think you should go about it. Make
a visit to your grocery store or to the market tomorrow,
and notice the good things that are in season and inexpensive.
Build your menu around them. When you get home,
sit down with a paper and pencil and plan everything out.
Go into detail, even if it takes several hours of planning.
It will be well worth it. I don't mean by that an elaborate
luncheon; it ought to be a simple and delicious one, but
complete in every detail. When I plan, I write down the
things that I can do the day before, and even the day before
that. You know there are always so many things to see to&mdash;polishing
the silver and writing the name cards and seeing
that the table linen is in order. It ought to be planned
so that the day of the party won't be crowded full of 'last
minute things.' Come into the kitchen with me, Ruth; I

<h2>CHAPTER CXLII</h2>

<div class='chaptertitle'>THE NEW CAR</div>


<div class='cap'>"DO stay to dinner, Ruth!" begged Bettina. "Bob is
going to drive the new car out when he comes,
and we'll have him take us for a spin after dinner."</div>

<p>"Oh, Bettina, has Bob really bought it? Will you really
have a car of your own?"</p>

<p>"Yes, indeed, we will. I can hardly realize it myself,
and although I'm so happy over it, I have a little haunting
fear that perhaps it is too great an extravagance. But
we'll enjoy it so!"</p>

<p>"Of course you will. I'm so glad! Won't the summer
be delightful when you can get out into the country every
day!"</p>

<p>"Ruth, you must stay to dinner and see the car for yourself!
I planned a special little celebration dinner, a kind
of salad that Bob particularly likes, and a good dessert,
too. And now, if you'll come into the kitchen with me, I'll
show you how to make peanut butter rolls. You never
heard of them? Well, they're a little like pinwheel biscuit.
Don't you remember the pinwheel biscuit that I make sometimes&mdash;baking
powder biscuit dough rolled out and spread
with butter and sugar and cinnamon&mdash;then rolled up and
cut like cinnamon rolls and baked?"</p>

<p>"Of course, I remember, Bettina! They're the best little
things, and so easy to make!"</p>

<p>"Well, these peanut butter rolls are like them, but spread<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_438" id="Page_438">[438]</a></span>

<p>Mix the flour, baking powder and salt thoroughly, cut

Add the milk, mixing with a knife until a soft dough is

a floured board or on a paper. The dough should be half
an inch thick. Cream the butter, add the peanut butter
and spread on the biscuit dough. Sprinkle the currants on
the top. Roll up carefully, over and over like a cinnamon
roll. Cut off pieces half an inch wide and pat them down
in a tin pan. Bake eighteen minutes in a moderate oven.</p>

<div class='chaptertitle'>MRS. DIXON HAPPENS IN</div>


<div class='cap'>"I MUST hurry home to get dinner," said Mrs. Dixon.
"See, Bettina, I've been to the market! Isn't this a
fine big cantaloupe? I have two more just like it. Frank
is very fond of them, but&mdash;&mdash;" she added ruefully, "I like
them cold, of course, and after I've fixed them and had them
in the refrigerator a while, everything in it&mdash;milk, butter
and eggs&mdash;has the cantaloupe taste!"</div>

<p>"I'll tell you how you can prevent that, Charlotte. Of
course they must be very cold when served, but I never
prepare them till just before the meal. I put them in the
ice box whole, in a paper sack, taking care that the mouth
of the sack is closed. They become very cold that way,
and at the same time can't affect the other food."</p>

<p>"I'm so glad you told me that, Bettina. I've learned a
great many things from you, haven't I? Oh, yes, another
thing puzzles me. I like chipped ice served in and with
the cantaloupe, and I don't own any tool for preparing the
ice. I do fix it somehow, of course, but I've wondered how
other people manage."</p>

<p>"Well, there are regular ice shavers, you know; but I
haven't one, either. I keep a salt sack that I use for that
purpose whenever I need just a little chipped ice. It isn't
hard to break off a piece small enough to go in a salt sack;
in fact, you usually have one in your ice box already. I
put it in the sack and break it fine with the flat side of a
small hatchet."</p><p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_444" id="Page_444">[444]</a></span></p>

<p>"Well, I've learned something more, and I'll use the
knowledge tomorrow evening. I must be going now. How
lovely those asters are on your dinner table! They seem
to prophesy an especially good meal! Do tell me what you
are going to have! I never can think of a variety&mdash;simple

<p>"Well, a dear old Aunt of Bob's presented her with some
wonderful kitchen scales&mdash;an aid to economy. Then it seems

Why didn't you leave it for Frank to bring?"</p>

<p>"Because I needed the things for dinner."</p>

<p>"What did you get?"</p>

<p>"Oh, the same old fresh vegetables," said Charlotte wearily.
"A month ago they seemed so wonderful&mdash;strawberries,
asparagus, new potatoes and all&mdash;but there are no new
ways to cook them! One day I cream the asparagus and
the next day I serve it on toast."</p>

<p>"Do you ever make asparagus salad?" asked Bettina.
"We are very fond of it. Cold cooked asparagus is good
with any kind of salad dressing, but we like best a very
simple kind that I often make&mdash;oil and lemon juice and
cheese."</p>

<p>"Cheese?" echoed Charlotte in surprise.</p>

<p>"Yes, cottage cheese and Roquefort cheese are equally
good. And, Charlotte, if you want some delicious strawberry
desserts&mdash;&mdash;"</p>

<p>"Oh, I do! We're so tired of shortcake and plain strawberries!"</p>

<p>"I know several good strawberry dishes. Come, let me

rain?"</div>

<p>"Rain? When? Tonight?" asked Bob, absent-mindedly,
for he was busily eating the first cherry cobbler of the
season, and enjoying it, too.</p>

<p>"No, stupid! I'm thinking about the wedding&mdash;Ruth's
wedding."</p>

<p>"And Fred's wedding, too," added Bob. "You talk as if
Ruth were the only one who is vitally interested."</p>

<p>"Fred's wedding, then. For, you see, the ceremony is to
be in that darling summer house if it doesn't rain. If it
does it will have to be in the solarium. The bridesmaids
and matrons (if it is an outdoor wedding) are to carry the
prettiest green silk parasols that you ever saw. They will
be Ruth's gifts to us. Over our arms we'll carry plain soft
straw hats filled with pink peonies, and lots of trailing
greenery. Won't that be lovely? For you know we are
all to wear short white dresses and white shoes."</p>

<p>"And what am I to do?"</p>

<p>"You're to be an usher and help carry the green ropes
that form the aisle."</p>

<p>"Ropes?"</p>

<p>"Yes, plain ropes covered with greenery. Will you have

<div class='cap'>"IF you girls only would, my dear," Ruth's mother had
responded to Bettina's suggestion that she and Alice
entertain Ruth's house guests the entire day before the wedding,
"you have no idea what a load would be taken off my

<p>"And Alice and I would so enjoy helping you," Bettina had
replied. "And remember, we mean the whole day, breakfast
and all!"</p>

<p>Luckily, the day before the wedding dawned warm and clear
At eight o'clock Harry and Bob drove them all in automobiles
to a lovely country spot in which the girls served an outdoor
breakfast. The morning was spent in motoring and luncheon
was eaten at a charming downtown tea-room. Then they were
whisked off to Bettina's little home for an informal afternoon,
and Harry and Bob, feeling that they had indeed been model
husbands, departed for their respective offices.</p>

<p>"The girl from Kentucky has volunteered to sing," whispered
Alice to Ruth. "She's a dear. Do you suppose we can
keep Aunt Jenny from talking for half an hour?"</p>

<div class='chaptertitle'>THE BRIDESMAIDS' DINNER</div>


<div class='cap'>RUTH'S wedding colors were to be pink and green, and
pink and green were, therefore, the colors which decorated
the charming dinner table laid for the wedding party and
close relatives the night before the wedding. A bud vase holding
a half-opened pink rose bud stood before every two places.
A large, low dish in the center of the table held pink roses,
while at either end was another low arrangement of the same
flowers.</div>

<p>Tiny paper slipper nut cups at each place held the pecans,
and at the places laid for the best man and the ushers, silver
pencils, Fred's gifts to the groomsmen, were found.</p>

<p>"They are cunning, of course," chattered Bernadette, Ruth's
cousin and maid-of-honor, "but you men just wait till you see
the green parasols that we bridesmaids are to carry! Ruth is
giving them to us, you know!"</p>

the usual hush for a moment, and then Ruth and Fred were
engulfed in a sudden rush of chattering friends, eager to offer
congratulations. Bettina and Bob were swept off with the others
to the house, where the wedding breakfast was waiting to
be served.</div>

<p>"The morning is after all the happiest time for a wedding,"
whispered Ellen to Bettina, as they found their places at the
bride's table. "Everything seems so fresh and new and green
and hopeful! Isn't the table lovely, Bettina?"</p>

<p>And indeed it was. Rose-decorated again, with the graceful
flowers in baskets, and the white bride's cake in the center
of the table, Bettina felt that it made the proper setting for the
flushed and smiling little bride.</p>

<p>"And the wedding cake is to be passed in darling little baskets,"
continued Ellen. "Little baskets with handles&mdash;and the
cake in tiny packages tied with white ribbon! Pink and green
candy all around them, too!"</p>

<h2>CHAPTER CLII</h2>

<div class='chaptertitle'>THE FIRST YEAR ENDS</div>


<div class='cap'>"AND a whole year has gone since then," said Bob, as his
eyes met Bettina's across the little table set for two.</div>

<p>"That's the queer part of it," Bettina replied. "That year
seems unbelievably short in some ways and unbelievably long
in others, and stranger yet, I don't feel that it is really gone.
I feel as if we had it, captured, held forever, with all of its
fun and all of its little sad times. We own it, even more than
we own a collection of snapshots in a camera book&mdash;because
that year is a part of us now."</p>

<p>"And the little hard places only make the bright spots all
the brighter by contrast. Do you know, Bettina, that I've
found you wiser than I ever imagined a young wife could
be?"</p>

<p>"Bob,"&mdash;and Bettina laughed and blushed at the same time.</p>

<p>"Don't interrupt. This is our anniversary and I'm making
a speech. You are wise because from the first you've realized
that we get out of life just what we put into it. You've faced
things. You've realized that marriage isn't a hit-or-miss proposition.
It's a business&mdash;&mdash;"</p>

<p>"A glorified business, Bobby. Dealing in materials that can't
all be felt and seen and tasted, but that are, nevertheless, just
as real as others. More truly real, I sometimes think. I
know that the more love we give the more we receive, but we
can't forget that we were given intelligence, too. So we mustn't
turn the rose-colored lights of romance too beautifully low<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_462" id="Page_462">[462]</a></span>
to let us see the wheels go round. And after all, romance is
really in everything that we do lovingly, and intelligently. I
find it in planning and cooking the best and most economical
meals that I can, and in getting the mending done on time, and
in keeping the house clean and beautiful. And&mdash;in having you
appreciate things."</p>

<p>"If you knew how I <em>do</em> appreciate them!" said Bob. "Let's
make our second year even happier than the first. If that is

<div class='recipetitle'><b>Currant Jelly</b> (Five glasses)</div>

<div class='ingredients1'>
2 qts. of currants<br />
1 <abbr title="cup">C</abbr>-water<br />
Sugar<br />
</div>

<p>Pick over the currants, leaving the berries on the stems.
Wash and drain. Place in an enamel preserving kettle and
add one cup of water. Cook slowly until the currants are
white. Strain through a jelly bag. Boil the juice five minutes
in a shallow pan. It is better to boil small quantities at a time,
as this makes the jelly much clearer. When the juice has all
been boiled, measure, and add an equal amount of heated
sugar. Boil three minutes, or until it jells when tried on a
cold saucer. Pour into sterilized glasses. Allow to stand in
the sun twenty-four hours. Cover with boiling paraffin and
put away in a cool, dark place. This recipe makes about five
glasses or two and a half pints.</p>


<div class='recipetitle'><b>Tomato Salad</b> (Two portions)</div>

<div class='ingredients2'>
4 slices tomato, ½ inch thick<br />
3 <abbr title="tablespoon">T</abbr>-chopped green pepper<br />
½ <abbr title="teaspoon">t</abbr>-salt<br />
¼ <abbr title="teaspoon">t</abbr>-paprika<br />
<span class='small'><sup>1</sup>/<sub>8</sub></span> <abbr title="teaspoon">t</abbr>-celery salt<br />
2 <abbr title="tablespoon">T</abbr>-olive oil<br />
2 <abbr title="tablespoon">T</abbr>-lemon juice<br />
2 pieces lettuce<br />
</div><p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_463" id="Page_463">[463]</a></span></p>

<p>Mix the salt, paprika, celery salt, olive oil and lemon juice.
Beat one minute. Add the tomatoes and green pepper. Place
in the ice box for half an hour. Arrange the lettuce leaves
on salad plates. Place two slices of tomato on each portion.
Pour the oil mixture over the tomatoes.</p>


<div class='recipetitle'><b>Charlotte Russe</b> (Two portions)</div>

<div class='ingredients1'>
2 <abbr title="teaspoon">t</abbr>-granulated gelatin<br />
2 <abbr title="tablespoon">T</abbr>-cold water<br />
¼ <abbr title="cup">C</abbr>-hot milk<br />
1 <abbr title="cup">C</abbr>-whipped cream<br />
½ <abbr title="teaspoon">t</abbr>-vanilla<br />
4 thin pieces sponge cake<br />
¼ <abbr title="cup">C</abbr>-sugar<br />
</div>

<p>Place the sponge cakes around the edges of a moistened
mould. Soak the gelatin in cold water five minutes. Add the
hot milk. Stir until it dissolves. Add the sugar and vanilla.
Allow the gelatin mixture to cool. When it begins to thicken,
fold in the cream. Beat until the mixture holds its shape.
Pour into the mould. Allow to remain two hours in a cold
place.</p><hr class="chap" /><p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_468" id="Page_468">[468]</a></span></p>
